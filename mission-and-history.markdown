  ## Vision

  We envision a DC where every child – no matter their family income – experiences the joys of childhood: sports, arts, service, and being part of a team. Where every child – no matter their family circumstances – is empowered to find academic success and grow into an emotionally and physically healthy teen and adult. Where every neighborhood supports and celebrates its children and their accomplishments on and off the playing field.

bottomText:
- Julie Kennedy, a former teacher at Marie Reed Learning Center, invented this complementary
  combination of activities in 1994 when she began working with a group of 15 girls
  with little to do after school. Ms. Kennedy learned that the team-centered relationships
  built on the soccer field translated into poetry workshops, and the development
  of teamwork and leadership prepared students to act as agents of change in their
  communities through service-learning projects.
