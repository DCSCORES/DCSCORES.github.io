## Giving Tuesday

[#GivingTuesday](https://www.givingtuesday.org/) is a global day of giving fueled by the power of social media and collaboration. 

Celebrated on the Tuesday following Thanksgiving (in the U.S.) and the widely recognized shopping events Black Friday and Cyber Monday, #GivingTuesday kicks off the charitable season, when many focus on their holiday and end-of-year giving.
