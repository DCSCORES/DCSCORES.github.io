America SCORES will be introduced in many American homes during the FIFA Women’s World Cup, with some help from Volkswagen. Using its own advertising time, Volkswagen, working alongside with America SCORES, created a 30-second spot for America SCORES that will air during the FIFA Women’s World Cup, alongside Volkswagen’s own “Drive Bigger” campaign.
