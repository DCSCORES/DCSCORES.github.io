While Owen grew up in Boston, his passion for soccer, writing and service-learning propelled him to DC. Owen found DC SCORES and immediately jumped at the opportunity to volunteer and support the communications team. He currently attends Georgetown University, pursuing majors in both Business Management and Marketing. He serves as chair of all philanthropic efforts in his college fraternity and plays club soccer. Owen is extremely excited with the opportunity to impact the lives and experiences of kids in all communities around DC through the three components of the program that has impacted his own.
