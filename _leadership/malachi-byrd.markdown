You won’t get five minutes into a conversation with Malachi Byrd, without hearing about Washington, D.C. An author, teacher, songwriter, and arts advocate from the district, Malachi believes superpowers exist in creative writing. An African-American Studies graduate from Princeton University, MalPractice gets his name from his commitment to mastering his crafts, and staying ready so he never has to get ready. If you follow performing arts in D.C., you’ve probably seen him practice rapping, laughing, and hugging everyone in the room. He often asks, art is made of healing properties, so why not use them? The inaugural Youth Poet Laureate of the nation’s capital has published three books and four albums in his twenty-five years and intends to publish many more. The founder of the Crowning Too Early Scholarship Fund, Byrd sees philanthropy as community restoration and dedicated his life to ‘lifting as he climbs.’
