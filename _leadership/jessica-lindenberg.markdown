Jessica grew up in Bethesda, MD, and graduated from Franklin & Marshall College in May 2018 with a double major in Sociology and Spanish. At F&M, she was a member of the Women's Club soccer team and volunteered in a 3rd grade classroom helping to teach math. Jessica is so excited to be a Program Coordinator at DC SCORES this year through Avodah. She is glad to be able to bring her passion and enthusiasm for social justice work to her role and looks forward to collaborating and learning from the kids in the classroom, and on the field!
