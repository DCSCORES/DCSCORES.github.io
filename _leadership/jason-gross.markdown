Jason is the Senior Program Director of Soccer and Operations at DC SCORES, ensuring high-quality programming across all program segments. He brings more than 16 years of experience as an NCAA Men’s and Women’s soccer coach, Academy and Sporting Director, and educator with DC Public Schools to his role.

A native Washingtonian, Jason strongly believes in the importance of DC SCORES programming and strives to ensure that DC SCORES Poet-athletes are more prepared to succeed in life due to their time in our program. For Jason, every day at DC SCORES is an opportunity to make an impact through positive youth development, and he can’t think of a better reason to get out of bed in the morning.
