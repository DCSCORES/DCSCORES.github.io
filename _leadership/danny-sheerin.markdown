Danny graduated from Penn State University in 2015 where he played on the men’s soccer team and majored in Supply Chain and Information Systems. Post-graduation, he worked in Philadelphia as a Supply Chain Specialist for 3 years. Danny originally hails from College Park, MD, and is very excited to work for social change in DC. He can’t wait to become part of the DC SCORES' mission that uses three of his passions: soccer, poetry, and service to positively impact children’s lives.
