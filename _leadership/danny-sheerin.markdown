Danny joined DC SCORES in 2019 to pursue a career he was passionate about. Prior to DC SCORES, he studied Supply Chain Management and Information Systems at Penn State University, where he played goalkeeper on the men’s soccer team. In his current role, Danny’s primary focuses are middle school programming and fostering relationships between schools and their corporate sponsors.  Danny is originally from College Park, MD and loves the DC area.  Danny’s favorite part of his work is being in an after-school setting with the poet-athletes and coaches, and his favorite DC SCORES events are the Fall Poetry Slams.
