As a Program Coordinator for DC SCORES, Saede helps facilitate the organization’s major programming events and liases with coaches and program sites to ensure the provision of quality equipment and programming. Saede grew up playing soccer in the United States and Germany and was on the women’s soccer team at Haverford College, where she earned her B.A. in Anthropology and Arabic. She has a passion for using sport for social change, sparked by her experiences working with refugees, including at the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants. In her free time, she coaches youth soccer and supports the Washington Spirit. She is excited to connect with the passion and hard work DC SCORES poet-athletes showcase through soccer and poetry.
