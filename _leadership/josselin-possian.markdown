Josselin Possian was born along the Ivory Coast of West Africa and moved to the USA in 2006. The DC SCORES Alum started his journey at SCORES in 2007, as a poet-athlete for Lincoln Middle School where he experienced the inaugural DC SCORES Jamboree and was a poetry slam champion. In 2012, he was among the two players selected to represent the USA at the Nike The Chance Competition, playing throughout Europe; in France, Spain, Germany, and Holland. Possian is currently playing his third season as a professional midfielder for the Maryland Bobcats.

DC SCORES is home to him and Possian is grateful to be granted the importunity to give back to our youth in the community and show them that everything is possible with effort, dedication, patient, and most importantly faith.
