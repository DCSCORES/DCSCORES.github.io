Josselin Possian was born along the Ivory Coast of West Africa and moved to the USA in 2006. The DC SCORES alumnus started his journey at SCORES in 2007 as a poet-athlete at Lincoln Middle School, where he experienced the inaugural DC SCORES Jamboree and was a poetry slam champion. In 2012, he was among two players selected to represent the USA in the Nike The Chance Competition, playing soccer throughout Europe, including in France, Spain, Germany, and the Netherlands. Josselin is currently playing his third season as a professional midfielder for the Maryland Bobcats.

DC SCORES is home to him, and Josselin is grateful to be granted the opportunity to give back to youth in the community and show them that everything is possible with effort, dedication, patience, and most importantly faith.
