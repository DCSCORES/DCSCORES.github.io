Tony comes to DC SCORES with over seven years of experience fundraising for youth-serving nonprofits in DC. Most recently, he was the major gifts officer at The SEED Foundation, a network of public boarding schools.

Tony spent several years as a donor, volunteer, and advocate for SCORES before officially joining the team. He can still hardly believe that an organization exists in his city that combines the three most important activities of his own childhood: soccer, writing, and service-learning. Tony is originally from Carlisle, PA, and graduated from Georgetown University with a degree in English.
