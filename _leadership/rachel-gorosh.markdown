Rachel is from the Detroit Metro area and she graduated from the University of Michigan in 2017 with a major in Organizational Studies and a minor in Community Action and Social Change. Rachel spent five summers working at summer overnight camps, where she developed her passion for youth development and working with kids of all age groups in a fun and engaging setting. While in school, Rachel volunteered as a group leader at Washtenaw County Youth Center conducting art therapy workshops. All of these experiences, combined with her course of studies, inspired her to participate in Avodah: The Jewish Service Corps. She is excited to be part of the DC SCORES team and the Washington DC community.
