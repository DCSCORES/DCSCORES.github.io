There he helped design and implement “11 for Health in Africa,” a public health campaign aimed at African youth that combines soccer with 11 different health, social, and life skills messages. The "11 for Health" program has since expanded to eight other countries. While in Africa, he also co-founded Ragball International, a soccerbased income-generation and entrepreneurial development program. Prior to Grassroot Soccer, Sean worked at the U.S. Soccer Foundation where he helped oversee the Passback Program and manage grants.
