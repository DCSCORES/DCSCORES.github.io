Ronald is an Up2Us Fellow on the Programs team at DC SCORES. Born in California but raised in DC, Ronald is excited to support neighborhood teams across his home city through his work with SCORES. Ronaldâ€™s mother is from El Salvador and his father from Guatemala, so he is fluent in Spanish. At DC SCORES, Ronald ensures that coaches receive all the equipment they need for training, gamedays, and major events. He also serves as a coach for the Capital City Public Charter School DC SCORES elementary team. In his free time, Ronald enjoys exploring different areas of the DMV and is always looking for new  recommendations for festivals and restaurants in the area.
