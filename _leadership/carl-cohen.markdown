Carl is a consumer product marketer from the Midwest assisting DC SCORES with special projects and grant writing since 2016. His first four years in DC were spent as a pro bono consultant for over twenty non-profits through COMPASS and the Taproot Foundation until settling down at DC SCORES full-time.

He has ten years of experience in youth marketing as a product manager at the Schwinn Bicycle followed by Director of Marketing at Sassy Infant Products. As Director, New Product Development at Sima, four products he developed received Consumer Electronic Show (CES) Annual Design & Engineering Awards.

Juno Lighting recruited him to jump start their marketing group just before the 2000's construction boom. The subsequent bust led to an MA-Teaching degree and middle school teaching in both Chicago’s North Shore and inner city.

DC SCORES’ after-school sports and literacy programs naturally fit his combination of youth/sports marketing and classroom teaching experience.
