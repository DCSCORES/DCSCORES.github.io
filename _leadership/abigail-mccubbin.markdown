Abigail currently attends Nebraska Wesleyan University in Lincoln, Nebraska, studying Sports Management and Communication Studies, with a minor in marketing. Originally from Kansas City, she joins us as the America SCORES Communications Fellow after her time as a Marketing and Graphic Design intern for DC SCORES. During her time at NWU, she was a member of the volleyball team, the new student orientation team and was an Event Manager for the athletic department. Abigail is excited to continue working with SCORES and can't wait to continue spreading the message of how incredible the SCORES organization is!
