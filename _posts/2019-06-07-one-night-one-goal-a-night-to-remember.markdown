Audi Field opened its gates once more for an evening celebration like no other to benefit DC SCORES.

*One Night One Goal* came back for the second time since October 2018 with even more surprises and exclusive experiences for its attendees. Throughout the night guests had the opportunity to see Audi Field like they never have before as they mingled with the stars from **D.C. United** and the **Washington Spirit**.





The summer-like, humid evening started off at the Heineken MVP Club for the Poetry Lounge presented by [Busboys and Poets](https://www.busboysandpoets.com/). Soccer and poetry combined as guests enjoyed spoken-word performances by professional spoken word artists like [Pages Matam](https://twitter.com/pagesofle) and [Marjan Naderi](https://twitter.com/marjaanxpoetry), as well as some of our DC SCORES poet-athletes from [Our Words Our City](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07MX494PW/).

While the room filled with the words of the region’s best artists, poet-athletes from **Cardozo Education Campus** showcased the soccer skills they’ve developed over the season on the same pitch where the pros showcase their talents.

Throughout the night, guests saw the players’ point-of-view as they were led by D.C. United staff members for a locker room experience that included a tour of the first team’s locker room, media room, press box and the players’ tunnel for the full game day experience. 

One of the most anticipated add-on experiences of the night was the penalty kick experience, where lucky attendees took their best shot on the field against [Loudoun United](https://www.loudoununitedfc.com/) goalkeeper, Colin Miller.
