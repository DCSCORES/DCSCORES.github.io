In the heart of the Shaw Neighborhood, multiculturalism is celebrated each and everyday at Seaton Elementary in each and every person. Multitudes of students and teachers from all walks of life strive to make their school community a more enriching experience. An experience that allows students and teachers alike to be proud of who they are individually and collectively as a student body.

This past spring, [DC SCORES ](https://www.dcscores.org/)students at Seaton Elementary School researched how to get students and teachers at their school to learn about different cultures. With the leadership of DC SCORES service - learning coach, Claire Sontag,  they decided to assign each classroom in their school a country to research. The class would need to create the best looking, most creative or most informative door with all the information they learned about that country.

Whichever three classrooms had the best looking, most creative or most informative door would win the annual door decorating contest for the year!

But learning and understanding different cultures is **more** than just a door decorating contest for the students and faculty at Seaton Elementary. It meant celebrating who they are as a student body. This meant only one thing. That a multicultural celebration was in order!

Ms. Sontag and her DC SCORES students arranged for a multicultural day to take place. 

On May 23rd, students and teachers would organize cultural festivities including a parade, artistic performances and a food potluck festival that invited the school community to try foods and dishes from different countries. Students, parents and teachers were able to celebrate their own cultures whilst learning about other cultures. 

This enriching experience goes to show that learning does not start and end at the classroom door. It occurs beyond the walls of Seaton Elementary and in the community they have created. DC SCORES students at Seaton Elementary were able to tie their community together by celebrating the cultural experiences that make each Seaton Elementary community member unique.
