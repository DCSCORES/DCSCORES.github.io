This spring, we are following Amidon-Bowen's season highlighting their service-learning project, but also attending games and soccer practices. The Tigers are located in Southwest D.C. in Ward 6. You can follow along on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DCSCORESInterns) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dc_scores/).

Last week the Amidon-Bowen Tigers were in high spirits for programming Monday.

As usual, the poet-athletes began outside for soccer practice. Coach Lee started the practice with dribbling and footwork exercises, in the hopes of helping the students gain confidence on the field. Next, they did some 1 v 1 drills and then finished practice with a little scrimmaging. Several kids got the opportunity to try playing goalie.


Then it was service-learning time! As part of their project Fight 4 Fitness, students focused last week on either a poem, story, or play about how they have been affected by gun violence and how detrimental guns are to living in a healthy, happy community.

When coach Pecot gathered everyone together, their writing complete, the students shared with each other about how they had heard guns, seen guns, and had family members affected by guns.

Finally, the whole class, teachers included, recited a pledge against gun violence:

The Pledge
I will never bring a gun to school;
I will never use a gun to settle a personal problem or dispute;
I will use my influence with my friends to keep them from using guns to settle disputes.
My individual choices and actions, when multiplied by those of young people throughout my city, will make a difference.
Together, by honoring this pledge, we can reverse the violence and grow up in safety.

After reciting, the students all signed their pledges as a measure of accountability, and returned them to Coach Pecot. The lesson was an important one that the students will highlight in their posters for their fitness expo to wrap up their service-learning project.
