Audi Field is finally open and DC SCORES is part of the D.C. United gameday experience!

DC SCORES Director of Writing, Charity Blackwell kicked off the opening week celebrations at the [Audi Field Ribbon Cutting Ceremony](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dcscorespictures/sets/72157697351543111) with a thought-provoking original poem. Truesdell summer campers also participated in the actual ribbon cutting next to Mayor Muriel Bowser; D.C. United’s Managing General Partner & CEO, Jason Levien; and General Partner, Erick Thohir.

Before the inaugural match kicked off, Charity performed her poem again in front of a sold-out crowd to get the fans pumped for the game. The [girls representing the USA at the Street Child World Cup](http://www.americascores.org/about-us/street-child-world-cup) were also recognized during the game as part of the [Community Star program](https://www.dcunited.com/community/star) presented by Brightspot.

As D.C. United’s official community partner, DC SCORES is ever-present at Audi Field! Here’s where to find us before and during D.C. United home games this season:

* **[All-Purpose Capitol Riverfront](http://allpurposedc.com/locations/capitol-riverfront/)**: Stop by the new All Purpose location in SW before D.C. United home games to enjoy the view of the Anacostia River and order a DC Brau Full Count Lager. $1 for every pint and $3 for every pitcher of Full Count Lager will be donated to DC SCORES for the rest of the season!

* **DC SCORES Promotional Spot**: Thanks to our friends at [Harrison Creatives](http://www.harrisoncreatives.com/), during every home game at Audi Field, the new DC SCORES promotional spot will air pre-game and at halftime. The video features D.C. United Head Coach, Ben Olsen, and other prominent D.C. United players like Steven Birnbaum, Paul Arriola, Chris Durkin and Wayne Rooney, as well as DC SCORES poet-athletes. This spot will change throughout the season, so be on the lookout for new additions!

* **EagleBank ATMs**: Using an ATM during the game? Thanks to D.C. United partner and DC SCORES supporter, EagleBank, the DC SCORES logo and information will be on all ATM machines inside Audi Field!

* **Section 138**: D.C. United, DC SCORES and supporter group, the [Screaming Eagles](https://www.screaming-eagles.com/), formed a partnership uniting a shared passion for enriching the communities in the District through sport.  As part of this partnership, Section 138 is the DC SCORES section at Audi Field. For every United home game, DC SCORES poet-athletes will have the opportunity to experience a professional soccer game in MLS’ newest stadium.

DC SCORES is excited to share the work we do in the community and continue providing more opportunities to our poet-athletes thanks to D.C. United!
