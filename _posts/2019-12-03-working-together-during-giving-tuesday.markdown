It only takes one individual can make an impact, and together, the lives of thousands of kids in the District can change for the better.

This Giving Tuesday (December 3), your support can go a long way to help kids reach their full potential. [A donation to DC SCORES](http://bit.ly/GivingTuesdayDCS19), no matter the amount, will help continue offering kids the opportunity to succeed on the playing field, in the classroom, and in life.





* $10: Gives one poet-athlete socks and shin guards

* $25: Provides transportation for a kid to travel to soccer tournaments and Poetry Slam

* $50: A microphone so a poet-athlete can use their voice and power on stage

* $100: Provides one poet-athlete with soccer equipment and writing supplies for one year

* $300: Provides soccer jerseys for an entire team with their school’s name on the back

* $500: Offers a full DC SCORES season for a child

* $1,000: Provides one elementary school student with the DC SCORES program for one year


We know that all of these opportunities are possible thanks to every single one of our donors. That’s why we want to **thank all of our Giving Tuesday supporters** in real time in a list below.

Thank you. We're going to say it a lot today because you're making a real impact on the lives in DC kids. **THANK YOU!**
