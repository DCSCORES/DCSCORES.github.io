All summer, DC SCORES summer camp has been in full-swing at John Lewis Elementary School!

DC SCORES summer camp would not be possible without the hard work and dedication of numerous volunteers who make the program special for elementary school students throughout the District.

DC SCORES partners with the [Mayor Marion S. Barry Summer Youth Employment Program](https://summerjobs.dc.gov/) (MBSYEP), which pays District youth between the ages of 14 and 24 to work over the summer in private and government sectors with the help of subsidies sponsored by the Department of Employment Services. Meet two MBSYEP students who are SCORES counselors this summer!
