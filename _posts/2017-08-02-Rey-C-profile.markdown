There is no doubt that once kids get to experience what DC SCORES is all about they become like family.

For some kids, there’s some hesitancy at first about joining, and then there are others like Rey C. who count down the days to become a part of DC SCORES.

First-time camper Rey is no stranger to the organization. His two older brothers, Bryant and Yair, have been in DC SCORES for a couple of years and share their enthusiasm about being in the program all the time. Rey always wanted to experience the fun his older brothers had for himself and he finally got the opportunity during the Truesdell soccer and arts summer camp.

The Jr. SCORES program for rising second and third graders gave Rey that chance he’s always wanted. The opportunity to be a part of DC SCORES and continue his brothers’ legacy of being in the program.

From the very first day of camp, Rey was ready to make the most out of the next five weeks.

Whether it was playing soccer, learning about healthy snacks, or getting to experience different field trips to the [Newseum](http://www.newseum.org/), the [Rock Creek Nature Center](https://www.nps.gov/rocr/planyourvisit/naturecenter.htm), or the [National Zoo](https://nationalzoo.si.edu/), Rey always made sure to have fun.

Camp Director, Will Sutton, describes Rey as “a little ball of energy!” Always with a smile on his face. Always hanging out with the new friends he made. Always a pleasure to work with for all the counselors. That’s Rey in a nutshell.

It’s great to officially have Rey in the DC SCORES family!
