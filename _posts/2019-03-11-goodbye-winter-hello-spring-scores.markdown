Today DC SCORES kicks off another season for our poet-athletes! After a long, cold winter, our poet-athletes will retake the field for practices and gamedays, while also continuing to learn about building teamwork and giving back to the community.

During the next 12 weeks, poet-athletes from across D.C. will participate in soccer and service-learning projects. DC SCORES poet-athletes will continue learning how to implement our three core values of teamwork, leadership, and commitment, with a continued emphasis on sportsmanship. 

DC SCORES runs the only consistent public soccer leagues for both elementary and middle school youth in DC. Each team practices twice a week, with gamedays on Wednesdays for Junior SCORES, Thursdays for elementary schools, and Fridays for middle schools. 

In addition to playing spring soccer, students at each school work together to identify an issue within their community, and the create a service-learning plan to address this issue. Past projects have included neighborhood and school cleanups, raising money for the homeless, and much more!

**Program Schedule**

DC SCORES programming occurs five days a week at elementary schools. Two days a week are designated for soccer practices and two days of service learning. On Thursdays, the poet-athletes participate in gamedays. On these days, teams play against other schools in separate boys and girls soccer games.

The middle school program meets three days a week, but have the same amount of service hours as elementary schools. In a block scheduling format, middle schools have both soccer and service-learning two days a week and game days on Fridays. DC SCORES has a girls, boys, and a co-ed league for middle schools.

The Junior SCORES program meets practices twice a week, with bi-weekly games on Wednesdays. This program focuses on introducing kids to DC SCORES, and the values of teamwork, leadership, and commitment. Junior SCORES programs are open to grades K-2.
