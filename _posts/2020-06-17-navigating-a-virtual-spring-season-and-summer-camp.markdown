The Spring SCORES season officially kicked off in early March as usual but quickly adapted into a virtual experience.

The pandemic we’re all currently facing is difficult for everyone. As an organization, our commitment to provide safe spaces and opportunities for our poet-athletes has only gotten stronger during these past couple of months.



 

In less than two weeks, the DC SCORES program staff created [SCORES at Home](https://parents.dcscores.org/at-home-activities), an online series of at-home soccer and writing activities designed to keep poet-athletes’ minds and bodies active until they can join their teammates back in school. Every single soccer and writing activity was made available in [Spanish](https://familias.dcscores.org/actividades-desde-casa) as well.   

The at-home activities were made up of both soccer and writing activities based on reflecting on the communities that poet-athletes are a part of. During the spring season, poet-athletes focus on developing and executing a service-learning project to help improve and support their community. Even though the format of this season was completely different, the emphasis on the community was still present.

DC SCORES’ special sauce has always been our coaches, and that has never been more true than over the past four months. 100 coaches from 55 sites spent over 1,000 hours connecting with their poet-athletes. As over 80% of DC SCORES coaches are also teachers at the schools where they coach, they are uniquely adept at navigating the distance learning challenges both at the schools and at kids’ homes. As a result, we’ve been able to consistently engage over 2,000 of our 3,000 poet-athletes during the pandemic. 

One of our coaches from Leckie Education Campus said, “It's good to see that the students miss soccer and writing. DC SCORES has such a positive impact on the kids that they look forward to actually engaging in virtual conversations.”

We typically end the spring season with SCORE Awards to recognize the all-star coaches and volunteers that stood out during the fall and spring seasons. Unfortunately, we weren’t able to have that special celebration live, but thanks to the help of other prominent coaches and poets in the community, we put together a [video](https://youtu.be/fG127IUlZsc) thanking them for making a difference in the lives of their students. Our partners [Timber Pizza](http://www.timberpizza.com/) and [Busboys and Poets](https://www.busboysandpoets.com/) also helped in showing our appreciation by sending them gift cards for their respective restaurants.

Once the spring season wrapped up on May 29th, the DC SCORES program staff has switched over completely to get the summer camps ready to go.The SCORES at Home Summer Camps will start on Monday, June 22nd and conclude on Friday, July 24th. This special edition of camp is open to any and all kids in rising grades 1-9 and is completely free. Our [SCORES at Home Summer Camps](https://summer.dcscores.org/) were created with SCORES participants in-mind (emphasizing our values of teamwork, leadership, and commitment) but are appropriate for all kids, even those outside of DC, to join and participate.

To help make sure all campers have whatever they need to fully participate in the camp, the DC SCORES and [D.C. United](https://www.dcunited.com/) staff have been working hard to pack over 500 boxes to mail that include camp supplies like a DC SCORES t-shirt, mask, jump rope, cones, a soccer ball, and more!

We know that this summer camp is going to be unlike any other camp DC SCORES has previously hosted, but the goal to provide kids an experience where they can play, explore, grow, and have fun is still the same.
