On **Thursday, March 22, 2018** the DMV area gets to combine their love for Chipotle and DC SCORES for their second annual fundraiser to support more than 2,500 poet-athletes at 59 sites in the District.

The task is simple. All you have to do is go to your nearest Chipotle restaurant in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area from **10:45am to 10:00pm** and tell the cashier youâ€™re supporting DC SCORES. Thanks to your purchase on Thursday, **50%** of the proceeds from your purchase will be donated to our organization! 

Win-win.
