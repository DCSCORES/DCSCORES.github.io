Once the school bell rings this afternoon signifying the end of the school day, thousands of kids in the District will get ready for the start of another Fall SCORES season.

This season, in particular, is significant because it is the 25th iteration of a season that combines soccer and poetry. Since 1994, DC SCORES has been providing a safe and fun environment where kids have the opportunity to enjoy being part of a team.

For the next 12 weeks, 3,000 elementary and middle school poet-athletes at [69 sites](https://www.dcscores.org/our-program/program-sites/) will be participating in soccer and poetry/creative writing activities every day after school.

### What’s new?

DC SCORES constantly looks for ways to improve programming to ensure that poet-athletes are part of a high-quality afterschool program.

* **New Curricula**: DC SCORES is excited to introduce new writing curriculum for middle school poet-athletes that includes new ways to engage participants to creatively express themselves. 

* **Middle School Soccer League**: In an effort to increase soccer accessibility to more kids, DC SCORES has partnered with the [Public Charter School Athletic Association](https://dcchartersports.org/) to create a new Middle School Soccer League for both DC Public Schools and DC Public Charter Schools.

* **Junior SCORES Expansion**: After introducing Junior SCORES in 2016 at Truesdell Education Campus, Junior SCORES is now at 15 sites! This program focuses on introducing kids to soccer and DC SCORES’ values of teamwork, leadership, and commitment. Junior SCORES participants have two soccer practices and one gameday each week.

* **New School Partnerships**: Every new school year, DC SCORES makes an effort to take interested schools off the waitlist by creating new partnerships that will bring programming to more schools. This year DC SCORES is excited to be at **Whittier Elementary School**, **Takoma Education Campus**, **Sela Public Charter School**, and **Ida B. Wells Middle School**!
