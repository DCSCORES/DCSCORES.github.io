**Award-winning nonprofit shows commitment to program expansion with additions**

\[Washington, DC\] – \[September 29, 2017\] – DC SCORES took another big step towards expansion by bringing eight corporate leaders onto its Board of Directors. These leaders, and the 14 Board members they are joining, are charged with growing DC SCORES sustainably and responsibly to serve every child in DC in need of a team. Over the past five years, DC SCORES, which provides free afterschool programs and summer camps to kids in high-poverty neighborhoods, has grown from 750 kids at 22 sites to over 2500 kids at 59 sites across the District. The new Board additions come on the heels of the organization [winning three awards for nonprofit management](https://www.dcscores.org/blog/2017/06/awards-day-dc-scores-wins-twice-in-one-morning) – the AIM for Excellence Award (for best-managed nonprofit in the DC-Maryland-Virginia area); the Center for Nonprofit Advancement Board Leadership Award (for best nonprofit Board in the region); and inclusion in the 2017-18 Catalogue for Philanthropy as “one of the best small charities in the Greater Washington region.”


Board Chair and Towne Park Senior Vice President, Human Resources Anthony Brown said: “DC SCORES has long been known for the meaningful, lasting impact we have on kids’ physical and social-emotional health. The addition of these new Board members underscores that DC SCORES also is a great investment and prime community impact partner for companies across the metropolitan DC area.”

Audi Vice President of Marketing Loren Angelo – who brokered a partnership with D.C. United that resulted in the District’s new soccer stadium being named Audi Field – is one of the new Board members. DC SCORES is D.C. United’s official community partner. “I joined the DC SCORES Board because, alongside our investment in Audi Field, Audi is committed to both growing the sport of soccer in DC and helping DC kids in need,” Angelo said. “There’s no better way to do both than through DC SCORES.”

The other new board members are:
•   Alex Diaz-Asper, Principal & Founder of VentureCount
•   Andrew Howell, Partner at Monument Policy Group
•   Ian Kline, President & CEO of The Cadmus Group, Inc.
•   Olga Palacios, IT Consultant at FICS
•   Skye Perryman, Senior Counsel at Democracy Forward
•   Julia Rao, Independent Executive Consultant (Former CFO, National Geographic Channels, US)
•   Anna Schneider, Senior Vice-President, Industry & Government Relations, Volkswagen Group of America.

“We are excited these corporate leaders have chosen to devote their time and energy to DC’s kids,” said DC SCORES’ Executive Director Bethany Rubin Henderson. “Each one brings something different to the table that will help us not only serve our current 2,500 poet-athletes for years to come, but also grow to sustainably serve thousands more.”
