**Can you tell us about yourself?**
My name is Maya Girum. I’m 10 years old, I attend Truesdell Elementary School. I have been in DC SCORES since I was 8/9 years old. When I grow up I want to work in NASA a little, be an author for my whole career life, and own a company a BIG one. 

**Where did you grow up?**
I mostly grew up in Ethiopia, but I’ve spent more than 2 years in the USA 

**What do you love most about performing your poetry?**
I love speaking out on stage — not singing. The audience is waiting for my voice. 

**What are your favorite things to write about?**
I love to write about things that make me feel calm.

**Who are your biggest supporters and why?**
My biggest supporters for poetry are my coaches. They helped me soooooooooooo much!

Other than me, Maya Angelou.
