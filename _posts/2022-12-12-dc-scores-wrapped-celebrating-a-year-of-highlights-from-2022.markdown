*2022 included the return of in-person poetry slams, the organization's most successful One Night One Goal gala, and a World Cup commercial placing DC SCORES poet-athletes at the center of this year's biggest soccer story.*














2022 was an important year for DC SCORES. More students than ever participated in the organization’s award-winning after-school program, which expanded to over 80 sites serving more than 3,000 poet-athletes across the District.

The end of COVID-19 restrictions enabled DC SCORES to host its first in-person poetry slams since 2019 and its biggest-ever One Night One Goal fundraising gala, which raised a record-breaking $440,000.

2022 also provided unprecedented opportunities to introduce more people to the work of DC SCORES thanks to a series of high-profile engagements with the Washington Spirit and D.C. United, an exclusive collaboration with FC Bayern Munich at Audi Field, and a donation of a 30s World Cup commercial slot for international network America SCORES from the tournament broadcaster FOX Sports.

Look back on some of the top DC SCORES moments from 2022 and learn more about the organization’s work this year.

On March 18, NWSL club and DC SCORES official community partner the Washington Spirit unveiled that DC SCORES would feature on the front of the team’s 2022 Challenge Cup jerseys. The exclusive kits represent the then-defending NWSL champions’ longstanding commitment to District poet-athletes and built on the club’s expanded support for DC SCORES during the COVID-19 pandemic, which included a donation of the team’s prize money from their 2021 Challenge Cup third-place finish.

“I love DC SCORES because poet-athletes can express themselves not just physically, but creatively and emotionally as well,” said Spirit forward and DC SCORES Board Member Ashley Hatch. “We’re incredibly proud to be repping them on our jerseys.”

The professional players also received some poetic inspiration when two DC SCORES alumni, JaQuan and DeAndre, shared their original work, prompting Davies to try his hand at spoken word.

This summer, poet-athletes from Brightwood and Burrville Elementary Schools had the opportunity to extend their DC SCORES programming and enjoy some fun in the sun with a special summer camp sponsored by CareFirst. The camps were held during afternoon sessions at both schools across July and August and featured soccer and poetry skills workshops and field trips around the District where students learned about the natural world around them.

One highlight included a special visit to Brightwood from D.C. United star Chris Durkin, who played soccer and made tie-dye shirts with campers. Summer camp was an opportunity for poet-athletes to continue to play alongside their team during the off-season. “Seeing their friendships form as their skills improve is amazing to see,” said camp counselor Emily Lobo-Castillo.

On September 6, poet-athletes from Houston Elementary School DC SCORES girls’ team walked out with the U.S. Women’s National Team (USWNT) during their Audi Field friendly against Nigeria. The Houston poet-athletes — who earlier this year won the Capital City Cup — stood alongside the soccer stars during the national anthem. The match was a historic one: after the game, players from the U.S. Women’s and Men’s National Teams signed collective bargaining agreements establishing equal pay.

Houston’s participation was secured by USWNT sponsor and DC SCORES partner Volkswagen. Tahirah, a Houston 5th-grader who held U.S. midfielder Sam Coffey’s hand as the group stepped out onto the field, said the moment was one she would treasure for the rest of her life. “I can have this memory forever!” she exclaimed.

On October 6, DC SCORES hosted its fifth annual One Night One Goal gala. The fundraiser raised nearly $450,000, the highest-ever fundraising total for a single DC SCORES event.

Guests were also treated to surprise poetry performances from D.C. United center-back Donovan Pines and Washington Spirit midfielder Gaby Vincent, who were both cheered on by their teammates in the audience. “I’ve always appreciated the spoken word and poetry aspect of the DC SCORES program,” said Shanell Mosley, Director of Community Relations at D.C. United. “Naturally, the highlight of One Night One Goal was seeing and hearing from the many poets in the Busboys poetry lounge, including D.C. United’s very own Donovan Pines.”

Across three nights in November, DC SCORES celebrated the return of in-person poetry slams after two years of virtual competitions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Pepco-sponsored slams saw more than 1,300 poet-athletes from over 40 schools perform at public school auditoriums across the city.

The slams were attended by special guests from D.C. United and the Washington Spirit, and Eduardo Perdomo, the newly-appointed Director of the DC Mayor’s Office of Latino Affairs, gave opening remarks at the Westside Slam. Judges Mariah Barber, Kenneth Carrol, and C. Thomas rated performances that explored a range of topics, from the impact of gun violence and social media bullying to students’ love for Trader Joe’s Orange Chicken. “We heard a lot of moving and dope poetry over all three nights. It was a joy to watch all the kids have fun,” said Barber.

On November 10 and 18, twelve of the District’s best middle school soccer teams competed in a series of thrilling knockout matches to be crowned champions of the 2022 DC SCORES Capital Cup. The competition for the trophy — which represents the culmination of DC SCORES’ middle school fall season — took place at Audi Field for the division championships and The Fields at RFK for the city championships.

Every match began with a sportsmanship talk by a DC SCORES staff member, which set the tone for play. “I was very impressed with the individual skill, teamwork, and, most importantly, sportsmanship during the event,” said Jason Gross, SCORES Senior Director of Soccer and Operations. “The Capital Cup is a competitive championship series and players didn’t lose sight of letting the game take away from our core values.”
