**WASHINGTON, DC** – One of the country’s elite youth soccer organizations, Bethesda Soccer Club, and award-winning nonprofit, DC SCORES, announce a partnership to grow and increase access to the sport of soccer in the DMV region.

DC SCORES, founded in 1994, serves 3,000+ kids at Title I schools and recreation centers throughout DC through a free afterschool program combining soccer, poetry and spoken word, and service-learning. Bethesda Soccer Club, founded in 1979, is made up of 65 boys and girls premier travel soccer teams (~1,500 players from across the DMV) that compete in top-level leagues along the East Coast and events throughout the United States.

The organizations are excited to collaborate and provide new, meaningful opportunities to the young people they serve through:
* Coaching Education
* Player Experiences
* Equipment Donation
* Co-marketing
* Jersey Sponsorship

While COVID restrictions may limit the ability to fully execute on some of the planned collaborations immediately, both organizations are committed to finding a way to provide a safe and enriching outlet for DC SCORES participants.

*“Since our inception in 1979, it’s been our mission at Bethesda Soccer Club to provide a competitive, supportive, challenging, and fun environment for players of all backgrounds to reach their potential through the game of soccer,”* said Jonathon Colton, Executive Director of Bethesda Soccer Club. *“We are thrilled to be able to
partner with DC SCORES to support their incredible programming and raise awareness of their cause by displaying the DC SCORES logo on our game jerseys.”*

DC SCORES’ Chief Executive Officer Bethany Rubin Henderson said, *“We are excited by the opportunity to engage the Bethesda Soccer Club community in DC SCORES’ mission and work, as well as the additional soccer resources for DC SCORES coaches and poet-athletes this partnership will facilitate.”*
