DC SCORES celebrated the 21st edition of Fall Frenzy on a chilly Saturday with over 1,000 elementary school poet-athletes ready for a jam-packed filled day with soccer, activity booths, and more.
 
From 9AM to 3PM, over 30 [DC SCORES sites](https://www.dcscores.org/our-program/program-sites/) gathered at [Trinity Washington University](https://www.trinitydc.edu/) for an annual elementary school soccer tournament and community festival.
 
Fall Frenzy started early in the morning for DC SCORES staff members as they prepared for a lively day. Before the teams, coaches, and families arrived, staff arranged arts & crafts booths, set-up the goals for eight fields, and pumped up the volunteers and referees for the kids ready to arrive.
 
Little by little, Trinity’s soccer field started to fill up with arriving teams that were eager to display the skills on the field they’ve been working on thus far during the [fall SCORES season](https://www.dcscores.org/blog/2018/09/as-august-comes-to-an-end-the-fall-scores-season-quickly-begins).
 
As tradition mandates, teams gathered around [DJ RBI](https://twitter.com/djRBI) waiting for Chief Program Officer, [Sean Hinkle](https://www.dcscores.org/about-us/leadership/sean-hinkle), to officially kick off the day with the DC SCORES sportsmanship speech and chant.

Throughout the day, teams rotated from soccer games to activity booths that included shooting accuracy drills, games from around the world, relay races, arts & crafts, and of course the ever-popular, face painting.
 
Teams from the eastside of the city played those from the westside – making new friends and showing DC SCORES’ three core values of teamwork, leadership, and commitment. 
 
As the day continued, the energy and enthusiasm never slumped for a second. As DJ RBI dropped beats all day, it wasn’t a surprise to see kids dancing in between their games, or even during them!

More than 175 new and returning volunteers joined DC SCORES poet-athletes for another amazing and successful Fall Frenzy. It's impossible not to recognize the support and efforts from all of the volunteers – from the drizzling morning before the coffee arrived until every cone and flag was picked up from the field. **Thank you to ALL the volunteers**, including groups from **Turner Construction**, **Hogan Lovells**, **Grant Thornton**, **Washington Latin Public Charter School**, **Penya Barcelonista DC**, **Volkswagen Group of America**, **Comfort Inn Downtown DC**, and many others!

This year, Fall Frenzy was proudly presented by [EagleBank](https://www.eaglebankcorp.com/). DC SCORES is thankful for their support and dedication to our poet-athletes and the community!

21 years of Fall Frenzy wouldn’t be possible without the coaches, families, volunteers, partners, and of course the kids!
