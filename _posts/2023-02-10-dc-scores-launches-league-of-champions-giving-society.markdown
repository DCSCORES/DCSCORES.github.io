DC SCORES has launched the League of Champions, an annual giving society made up of individuals who have made transformative gifts to the nonprofit.









 

The League of Champions honors contributions that provide long-term, consistent support for DC SCORES soccer, poetry, and service-learning programs across the District. Sustained revenue from the giving society will enable DC SCORES to reduce its school waitlist and empower more children to become poet-athletes. 

“The League of Champions will provide DC SCORES with a pipeline of regular, reliable support from individual donors. This will be a great foundation on which to build our future programs and work to achieve our goal of providing a DC SCORES program to every child in the District who needs it,” said Katrina Owens, Executive Director of DC SCORES.

Donors who give a combined amount of $1,000 annually are eligible to join the society. Members of the League of Champions gain access to exclusive benefits, depending on the overall gift amount, including complimentary and discounted tickets to DC SCORES events, quarterly impact newsletters, networking events, unique DC SCORES gifts, and more.

The League of Champions recognizes supporters at a variety of giving levels. Champion membership recognizes combined annual gifts starting at $1,000, Trailblazer membership is awarded for gifts starting at $5,000, while Changemaker membership is accessed via gifts of more than $10,000. 

The first League of Champions event of 2023, a virtual “kickoff call,” took place on February 8. Owens welcomed members to the new giving society, explained the benefits of membership, and opened up the discussion to allow new members to connect with one another. 

“This is an exciting opportunity to show our supporters how much we value their partnership and impact on our poet-athletes,” said Yasmin Ibrahim, Associate Director of Development at DC SCORES.
