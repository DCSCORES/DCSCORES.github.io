An opportunity.

That’s all it takes to change someone’s life.




DC SCORES has been providing opportunities for kids for over 23 years, and in the past six weeks, we've seen incredible evidence of where this program can take a child.

In late March, more than 150 high school alumni showed off an incredible amount of skill and teamwork — traits learned DC SCORES coaches over many years — during our largest alumni tournament EVER.

Weeks later in April, Uniyah C., age 10 from Miner Elementary School, traveled to Switzerland as the USA representative of the Eleven Campaign, a non-profit documentary bringing together 11 soccer-playing children from 11 countries across the world.

And now, a group of nine DC SCORES alumni girls are in Moscow, Russia, as the only team representing America in the Street Child World Cup — playing soccer and advocating about the issue of youth homelessness.

These opportunities wouldn’t be possible if DC SCORES did not equip kids with shoulder to shins uniforms, trusted and trained coaches, and a supportive team — on and off the field.

This Do More 24 — Thursday, May 17, 12pm until Friday, May 18, 12pm — please help provide DC children with a team by donating!

**$24:** Provide a soccer kit for a kid in need.

**$48:** A soccer uniform for a boy and girl.

**$96:** Writing supplies for an entire team.

**$299:** Soccer jerseys for an entire team.

**$500:** Full DC SCORES season for a child.

During Do More 24, each and every donor makes a direct impact. So we will give thanks below in real time — by listing every one of you. Keep refreshing to see your name added to the list of high 5’s. And...

**THANK YOU!**
