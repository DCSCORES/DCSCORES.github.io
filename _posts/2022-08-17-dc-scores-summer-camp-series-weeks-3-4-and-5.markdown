As we look forward to the fall season here at SCORES, let's take a look back at our last few weeks of Summer Camp! 





**Week Three**
Week 3 began with an exciting trip to the Natural History Museum, where the kids got to check out fossils, explore how mammals interact with each other, and how they can help make the earth a more sustainable place. This served them well later in the week when Forest Kids came into the classroom to explain how we get oxygen and the importance of trees.

The heat kept campers indoors this week – but the amazing, adaptable soccer coaches managed to keep things going, with games of soccer Capture the Flag. In STEAM, haikus and tankas were the focus. Each camper had a unique perspective on what makes a great poem and it showed when completing their works. Here are a few of the campers evocative and creative poems:

**Week 4**
The campers were back outside for Week 4. This week’s skill focus was shooting and some amazing goals were flying in from Day 1! On Tuesday, the campers went on a trip to the National Portrait Gallery and got the chance to learn about important figures from American history as well as marvel at some of the great artists from the past and present. Some favorites included the Automobile and American Art Exhibit and the Presidential Portraits!

On Wednesday, special guests D.C. United and CareFirst came to visit. They brought with them D.C. United midfielder, USMNT youth international and DC SCORES regular Chris Durkin to hang out with the kids, tie dye some shirts and join in with soccer. Being able to get some soccer tips from a professional was an amazing experience for the campers, and it was great to see the campers try and copy Chris’ shooting technique during the drills and listen to his positional advice during the games.

Forest Kids also taught the kids about insects this week. They got to take a special look at dragonflies, cicadas and spiders and how vital their role is in providing the food we eat.

Friday saw the campers truly put their soccer skills they have developed over the last 4 weeks to the test – it was time for coaches vs campers! Three hard fought games against each grade left the coaches exhausted, but great goals and effort from both sides made for a fun day.

**Week 5**
As campers entered their final week, their hard work and enthusiasm this summer was rewarded with a day full of fun and games! Campers got to play inside an awesome gaming truck, where they could turn their soccer skills virtual in a game of FIFA, battle their friends in Gang Beasts or get creative in Minecraft. They also got to cool off in the heat with a snow cone  and try out loads of cool flavors. The celebration day was capped off by a bouncy water slide – the coaches got to join in on the fun by spraying them too!

The last sessions with Forest Kids took campers to the ocean, and they had the opportunity to learn about shells, urchins, and take a look at a horseshoe crab. Over the 5 weeks of camp, Forest Kids have been a favorite among campers with their varied topics of learning, engaging activities and infectious passion for the outdoors.

Summer camp at Brightwood has been a successful and memorable month of soccer and STEAM. We can’t wait to see how the kids will use the skills they’ve picked up in the last few weeks in the fall season and beyond.
