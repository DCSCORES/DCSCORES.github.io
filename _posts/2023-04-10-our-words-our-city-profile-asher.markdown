**Can you tell us about yourself?**
My name is Asher. I’m 14 years old, I attend Duke Ellington School of the Arts. I have been in DC SCORES since I was 9 years old. When I grow up I want to be a bartender, and a teacher as a side job. I might teach people about mixology and the basics in bartending. 

**What are your hobbies?**
Archery, swim, walking, drawing, cooking, mixing drinks (when I was younger), creating stories 

**What do you love most about performing your poetry?**
The one main thing I love the most about performing my poetry is that I can vent about issues in either my life or around the world. 

**What are your favorite things to write about?**
My favorite things to write about would be both the good and bad events in the world because in the words of my world history teacher, “if something is going on in the world, what are you going to do about it?”

**Who is your favorite poet?**
My favorite poets would have to be Black Chakra and Malachi Byrd because they both encourage me to talk about family and life, even if it’s not the best memories or events.

**What do you like most about DC SCORES?**
What I absolutely like about DC SCORES is the energy because whenever I have a bad day, I tend to space out of reality and relive everything from my past. But, DC SCORES helps me relax quicker than other methods I’ve used.
