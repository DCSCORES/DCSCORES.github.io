*SCORES Cup takes place on June 22 at the Fields at RFK.* 





















Longtime DC SCORES partner MorganFranklin Consulting has been named as the presenting sponsor for [SCORES Cup](https://cup.dcscores.org/), DC SCORES’ annual soccer tournament fundraiser. ESPN 630 DC is also returning to the event for a second year as the official SCORES Cup media partner. 

SCORES Cup — which is the largest corporate charity soccer tournament on the East Coast — will take place on June 22 at the Fields at RFK. 46 company teams from across the DMV will battle it out to be crowned champions of the tournament’s Casual, Competitive, and Law divisions. 

All proceeds from the tournament, including team entry fees and fundraising, will support DC SCORES’ afterschool soccer, poetry, and service-learning programs at over 60 schools across the District.

SCORES Cup was founded in 2003, and [DC SCORES celebrated its 20th anniversary last year](https://www.dcscores.org/blog/2023/07/dc-scores-celebrates-20-years-of-scores-cup-with-a-record-breaking-tournament). In the two decades since its inception, SCORES Cup has grown to accommodate more than 800 players who not only participate in soccer matches, but also enjoy food trucks, partner activations, and a beer tent, which this year will broadcast international matches from UEFA Euro 2024.

“Typically, MorganFranklin sponsors One Night One Goal, DC SCORES’ fundraiser gala. But, when the opportunity came up to be the presenting sponsor for SCORES Cup, we jumped on it. DC SCORES is one of our favorite organizations — we believe in the mission and are happy to contribute in any way we can to advance it,” said Fred Hargrove, a partner at MorganFranklin and a DC SCORES board member. 

MorganFranklin will be fielding one of almost 50 teams that will compete for a trophy, but Hargrove stressed the event is more important than winning or losing. 

“One of our key principles as an organization is to 'play for each other.’ DC SCORES’ mission supporting our youth and helping them understand the power of creativity, teamwork, and collaboration speaks boldly to this principle,” he said. “Our team will do their best to win and then laugh it off if we don’t. We look forward to this event ever year no matter the outcome!”

MorganFranklin is not the only organization to partner with DC SCORES for the event. Sports radio station ESPN 630 DC will return as the SCORES Cup official media partner for the second year in a row. 

In addition to promoting the event on air and on social media, staff from the broadcaster will host an exciting activation at SCORES Cup that will include soccer-themed games, family activities, and a chance to learn more about ESPN 630 DC’s expansion into soccer coverage, including a [new radio partnership with NWSL team and DC SCORES official community partner the Washington Spirit](https://washingtonspirit.com/blog/2024/05/15/washington-spirit-announces-the-clubs-first-ever-radio-partnership/). 

“For our station, the decision to both continue and build upon our partnership with DC SCORES for the SCORES Cup was a no-brainer! Meeting some of the people who have been impacted by DC SCORES at last year’s SCORES Cup was a genuine highlight for us,” says Wardell McCabe, digital producer at ESPN 630 DC. “They helped illustrate how much of a family DC SCORES is, and, ultimately, we want to do anything we can to help that family grow.”

“We’re delighted to welcome MorganFranklin to SCORES Cup, and to welcome *back* our media partner, ESPN 630 DC,” said Tony Francavilla, Chief Development Officer at DC SCORES. “A lot of our impact in serving more than 3,000 kids in D.C. is down to incredible partners who are willing to step up in big moments like these and help us gain the support we need to continue supporting more youth in the District who need DC SCORES.”

He added, “It’s going to be a fantastic day, and I can’t wait to cheer on players from MorganFranklin, ESPN 630 DC, and all our teams, as we raise vital funds for poet-athletes across D.C.”
