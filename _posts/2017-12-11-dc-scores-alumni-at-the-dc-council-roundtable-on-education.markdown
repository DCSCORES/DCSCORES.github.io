> “What has helped me get through my schooling is the commitment that my teachers showed along with the support of multiple DC SCORES staff members.”

> “Being a part of the DC SCORES community has also helped me because there are so many resources I can use as far as applying to colleges or helping with resumes.”

Christian is currently a senior at Roosevelt High School and plans on attending college to study hospitality management.
