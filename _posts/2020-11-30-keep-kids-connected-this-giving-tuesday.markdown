The need this Giving Tuesday to keep kids connected is unlike ever before. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, kids remain at home and physically distant from their teammates, coaches, and school community.





Despite not being able to gather in person for months now, DC SCORES has never stopped serving kids in DC. Programming doesn’t *look* like usual, but DC SCORES has done everything possible for it to *feel* the same for our poet-athletes when it seems like everything else in the world is constantly changing.

Your support during Giving Tuesday can make an enormous difference in the lives of kids in DC. [A donation to DC SCORES](www.givelocaltogether.org/team/dcscores), no matter the amount, will help ensure that we can continue providing free soccer and writing programming, whether that's virtually or in-person (hopefully soon).

In the spring, DC SCORES built out [SCORES at Home](https://families.dcscores.org/at-home-activities), an online bilingual (English and Spanish) portal filled with soccer and writing activities for kids to do at home. During the summer, DC SCORES continued to offer free summer camps and shipped out hundreds of equipment kits to every camper with everything they needed to participate (soccer ball, pump, t-shirt, mask, hand sanitizer, journal, writing supplies, etc).

Building on the work from the spring and summer, DC SCORES has made this fall season engaging and fun to support kids, coaches, and families in this District. More player and coach kits sent, more Celebrity Guest Speakers, more incentives to keep kids motivated to play and write, but above all, **more opportunities to be connected** with their team during this time of physical distancing. *Whether we’re in person or virtual, DC SCORES is committed to keeping kids feeling safe, supported, connected, and hopeful.*

This Giving Tuesday, December 1st, please give the gift of keeping kids connected by donating to DC SCORES. Any amount makes the difference!
