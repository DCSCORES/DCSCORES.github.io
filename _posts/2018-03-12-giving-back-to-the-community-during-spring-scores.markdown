Today DC SCORES kicks off another spring SCORES season for our poet-athletes! Not only do poet-athletes get to step onto the soccer field again for practices and gamedays, but they also get the opportunity to continue building on the teamwork formed during the fall season to give back to their community.

During the next 12 weeks, more than 2,500 students in all eight wards in DC will participate in soccer and service-learning projects. DC SCORES’ poet-athletes learn the core values of Teamwork, Leadership, and Commitment with an emphasis, too, on the importance of sportsmanship.

DC SCORES runs the only consistent public soccer leagues for both elementary and middle school youth in DC. Each team practices twice a week and game days are on Thursdays for elementary schools and Fridays for middle schools.

During our spring season, kids at each site work together to identify and then research an issue in their school community, and then address it with a service-learning plan. Projects in the past have ranged from neighborhood and school cleanups, to awareness campaigns, to raising money for the homeless, and much more!

**Program Schedule**<br>
Elementary schools have programming five days a week. Two days a week are designated for soccer practices and two days for service-learning. Each Thursday, poet-athletes participate in game days, where schools play against other schools in separate girls and boys soccer games.

Middle schools have programming three days a week, but have the same amount of program hours as elementary schools. In a block scheduling format, middle schools have both soccer and service-learning two days a week and game days on Fridays. We have girls, boys and a co-ed league for middle schools.
