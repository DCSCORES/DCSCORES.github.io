On Saturday, October 26, 2019, DC SCORES celebrated its 22nd annual Fall Frenzy. Over 1,000 elementary school poet-athletes from over 30 different schools arrived bright and early for a fun-filled day of soccer, activity booths, and great music.
 
From 9AM to 3PM, DC SCORES teams gathered at **Trinity Washington University** for an annual elementary school soccer tournament and fun community festival.

Buses started flowing into Trinity University around 8:30am, but earlier that morning, with the help of the wonderful volunteers, DC SCORES team members set up information stations, 9 different playing fields, and several arts and crafts booths.
 
As per tradition, before the fun began, all teams, coaches, and volunteers gathered around [DJ RBI](https://www.instagram.com/dj_RBI/)’s station where [Sean Hinkle](https://www.dcscores.org/about-us/leadership/sean-hinkle), Chief Program Officer of DC SCORES, gave the iconic DC SCORES sportsmanship speech and chant.

Throughout the day, teams rotated from games, craft booths, soccer drills, and the crowd favorite: face painting. Teams were there from both the East and West side, making it so that kids were able to meet new people and make new friends! 

The positive energy was never scarce as DJ RBI played songs that the kids loved to sing and dance to. It was clear to anyone around that the kids were having an absolute blast as this year’s Fall Frenzy. Kids also got special visits from D.C. United player, Gordon Wild, and everyone's favorite mascot, Talon!

A big shoutout to all 130 new and returning volunteers that helped and participated in this year’s Fall Frenzy, including groups from Deloitte, Junior League of Washington, American University – CBRS, Notre Dame Mission, ARK, and many more. We appreciate all the hard work from the early morning set up to the afternoon cleanup (and of course all the fun in between).

Overall, Fall Frenzy perfectly reflected the three core values of DC SCORES: teamwork, leadership, and commitment. 

This year, Fall Frenzy was proudly presented by **EagleBank**. DC SCORES is thankful for their support and dedication to our poet-athletes and the community! These 22 years of Fall Frenzy wouldn’t be possible without the support from our coaches, families, volunteers, partners, and of course the kids!
