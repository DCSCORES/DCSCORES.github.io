Today (May 5th) is Giving Tuesday Now, a new global day of giving in response to COVID-19. 

DC SCORES needs your help. We're a team and together we will get through these difficult times. We want to make sure that as soon as it is safe, we're ready to keep providing every poet-athlete with a safe space so they can succeed on the playing field, in the classroom, and in life.





Your support can make a huge difference in the lives of kids in DC. [A donation to DC SCORES](https://bit.ly/GTNowSCORES), no matter the amount, will help ensure that we can continue providing free soccer and writing programming to over 3,000 kids.

In response to this new online world our students find themselves in, the DC SCORES team developed [SCORES At Home](https://parents.dcscores.org/at-home-activities?utm_source=DC+SCORES+newsletter&utm_campaign=75a7497b79-GivingTuesdayNow1&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_e7f56377b5-75a7497b79-49969617). These online, at-home soccer and writing activities are available in English and in Spanish to keep kids active until they can join their teammates back at school.

We know times are tough and we also know that kids are [at risk of negative physical and social impacts due to prolonged social isolation](https://medium.com/@coalition_49468/a-call-to-address-youth-isolation-during-the-covid-19-crisis-38a57753fdb9). $5, $10, $25 - anything - can make a difference to help combat these negative effects on our youth.

DC SCORES has been around since 1994, and we know that we wouldn't still be here today without our supporters. That’s why we want to **thank all of our Giving Tuesday Now supporters** in real-time in a list below.

Thank you. We’re going to say it a lot today because you’re making a real impact on the lives of DC kids. THANK YOU!
