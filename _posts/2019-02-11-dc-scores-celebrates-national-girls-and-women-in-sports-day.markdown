DC SCORES has a long history of supporting DC’s girls, making sure they have the opportunity to play soccer and be on a team no matter where they live in the city. Half of DC SCORES participants are girls and we have an amazing alumni team of high school girls as well. This pipeline of our programming provides our girls with the chance to play, bond and build leadership skills on and off the field.

We were excited to be able to bring 15 of our [Truesdell Education Campus](http://profiles.dcps.dc.gov/Truesdell+Education+Campus) DC SCORES’ team to George Washington University on February 5th to celebrate [National Girls & Women in Sports Day (NGWSD)](http://ngwsd.org/) with the [Women’s Sports Foundation (WSF)](https://www.womenssportsfoundation.org/). Founded in 1974 by tennis legend, Billie Jean King, the WSF is dedicated to creating leaders by ensuring all girls access to sports. DC SCORES has been fortunate to be a partner of WSF for many years, working together to create female athlete leaders in our community. The NGWSD event was a perfect opportunity to celebrate this partnership and spotlight incredible athlete leaders from around the country.

The Truesdell team was joined by peers from across the city and had a full afternoon of programming to celebrate women in sports. First, a panel of incredible champion female athletes, including Elana Meyers Taylor, Jessica Long, Meghan Duggan, Benita Fitzgerald Mosley, Phaidra Knight, Alana Nichols and Sasha DiGiulian, spoke about their experiences overcoming adversity to become leaders in their respective sports. U.S. Women’s Hockey team goalie and captain Megan Duggan spoke of the thrill of winning the gold medal in Sochi, the first gold for the women’s team, and the team’s successful fight to receive equal pay. Phaidra Knight, the first African-American and second America women to be inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame, spoke about the importance of resilience, strength and sportsmanship. After the panel, the girls then split into groups and played different sports (squash, tennis, softball and basketball) with GW student-athletes.

Our girls left the event feeling energized and inspired to be part of such an empowering community of female athletes from all over the city!
