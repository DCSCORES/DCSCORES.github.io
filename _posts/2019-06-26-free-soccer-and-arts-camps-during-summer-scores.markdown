[Summer SCORES](https://summer.dcscores.org/) has officially started with two, **free** soccer and arts camps offered to rising second-graders to rising sixth-graders at Truesdell Education Campus and Leckie Education Campus.

From June 24 to July 26, campers will have the opportunity to participate in activities geared toward keeping their bodies and minds active during the summer break. 






We strive to create a fun and welcoming environment for kids, and all camps are led by expert coaches and counselors who are trained in soccer and positive youth development. We provide each participant with a t-shirt and at least one meal every day of camp. 

Additionally, the camps bring kids together from different parts of the city â€“ building long-lasting friendships and exposing participants to different cultures.

The camp day is divided into arts programming and soccer programming for participants. Soccer activities are adapted for players of all experiences and consists of fun activities that focus on a different skill each day. 

For arts programming, outside experts are brought in to lead sessions on different topics each week, ranging from dance, painting, drumming, playwriting, etc. for participants to explore their creative side. 
Each camp also has weekly field trips and trips to the pool. Our camps culminate in a celebration that includes a BBQ, staff vs. players game, fun activities, and awards for players who display teamwork, leadership, and commitment throughout their time at camp.

The summer months are a critical period for low-income youth due to their [lack of activity](https://www.summerlearning.org/at-a-glance/) when not in school. Kids that don't have the resources to attend traditional summer camps often struggle with learning loss once classes resume. DC SCORES offers a solution to this issue by giving kids the confidence and skills to succeed on the playing field, in the classroom, and in life.
