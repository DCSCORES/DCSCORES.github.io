A voice. 

So powerful. 

That's what YOU can provide low-income DC kids on Giving Tuesday Nov. 28 with a [donation to DC SCORES](http://bit.ly/GiveToSCORES). It's that simple. Your support means allowing kids [like Uniyah](http://bit.ly/UniyahBravery) to be heard.
 

**$28** = Giving a kid the tools to succeed with a poetry journal and pencil, and a soccer uniform with school name on the back.

**$51** = Providing a microphone so a kid can be HEARD on stage.

**$121** = Giving a writing coach a year's worth of supplies to inspire kids to use their voices and power.

and **$498** = 24 hours of instruction by Poetry Specialists for a DC SCORES team.

During Giving Tuesday, because we understand how impactful each and every donor is, we will give thanks below in real time. Keep refreshing to see your name added to the list of high 5s. And THANK YOU!
