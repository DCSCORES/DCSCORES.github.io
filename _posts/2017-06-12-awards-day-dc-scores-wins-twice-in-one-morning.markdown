This morning was special for DC SCORES. By the time staff members walked into the office, our social media channels were blowing up.

We had received two huge honors in a matter of minutes. Talk about starting the week off right.


The first one we knew about. For the fourth time, the [Catalogue for Philanthropy chose DC SCORES](http://bit.ly/2017-18CFP) for inclusion in its annual catalogue celebrating the best nonprofits in Washington, DC. We have now been picked for the catalogue all four times we've been eligible and applied.

This is a tremendous testament to our continued work with kids -- now 2,200 served annually -- in communities across the District.

Minutes later, the [Center for Nonprofit Advancement chose DC SCORES](https://twitter.com/CenterNonprof/status/874260019684003842) as the winner of its 2017 Advancement in Management (AIM) Award. The AIM for Excellence Award Competition is an annual award presented to a Washington, DC metropolitan area nonprofit organization for outstanding achievement in organizational management.

This is what Susan Leon Seemann, an AIM Award Selection Committee Member, had to say about DC SCORES:

> â€œI was blown away by the deliberate process that DC SCORES has attacked each of their deficiencies. They understand no nonprofit is perfect, embrace their imperfections, come up with a way to improve them, measure their results, and make adjustments based on the results. This is the epitome of excellence in management and what this award is about."

DC SCORES is thrilled to have received such distinguished awards and looks forward to continuing to grow and strive to serve every child in DC in need of our year-round programming.

"These are both incredible honors," said Executive Director Bethany Rubin Henderson.

> "They are a testament to the work our staff, board of directors, and coaches put in to make DC SCORES a model kids-serving organization in Washington, DC. We look forward to continuing our growth as a program and also from a management standpoint as we move into our 24th year in the District."
