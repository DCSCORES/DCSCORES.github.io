Today marks the start of a nutritious adventure as the **Winter SCORES** season begins! Four DC SCORES sites will begin their five-week-long journey of soccer and nutrition to learn the many benefits of a healthy lifestyle.





The Winter SCORES season will run from January 13th to February 13th at **LaSalle-Backus Education Campus**, **Seaton Elementary School**, **Truesdell Education Campus**, and **Thomas Elementary School**.
 
Winter programming aims to get kids thinking about the choices they make when it comes to nutrition. 
 
The goal is to introduce the importance of combining exercise with nutrition. During the five-week season, poet-athletes will learn about the importance of properly fueling their bodies to perform their best on the field and in the classroom.

Each participant will get the opportunity to prepare healthy snacks and see for themselves the difference proper nutrition can make for an athlete during soccer clinics. Participating poet-athletes also get the opportunity to learn about nutrition in a fun way with hands-on activities and cooking sessions.
 
The curriculum, partially provided by [Common Threads](http://www.commonthreads.org/), covers a wide range of topics aiming to empower our poet-athletes to make healthier conscious eating choices. Each lesson will address a specific topic such as reading nutrition labels, serving size, food origins and drinks.
 
All of the activities and lessons culminate in the event of the season: Chopped Junior! This competition involves small groups at every site competing against the clock to impress judges, including local DC chefs, for the best healthy dish of Winter SCORES.
