Join the #AtHomePoetryChallenge!

Just because we’re stuck inside, doesn’t mean we can’t stay fit – and that means our minds and bodies. So here’s a challenge for your mind:  write and record your own "My Community" poem.

**Here’s how it works:**
1. [Download the poem](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YhpoKBdyQl0DUS74bKS3KKZFymkr8Wey/view?usp=sharing)
2. Write the poem using the prompts
3. Film yourself reading it and challenge two friends to do the same
4. Post it to your social media, tagging the two friends you challenge, tagging us ([@DCSCORES](http://twitter.com/dcscores)) and using the hashtag **#AtHomePoetryChallenge**

It’s quick, it’s fun, and it lets you be part of the solution – building a resilient, supportive community around the kids who need it the most.  Check out the first poem from our friend Joanna Lohman for an example – and then show us what you’ve got!
