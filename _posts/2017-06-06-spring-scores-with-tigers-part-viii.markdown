This spring, we are following Amidon-Bowen's season highlighting their service-learning project, but also attending games and soccer practices. The Tigers are located in Southwest D.C. in Ward 6. You can follow along on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DCSCORESInterns) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dc_scores/).

In the final edition of our series with the Tigers, I got the chance to hear from the kids and coaches how successful Fight 4 Fitness was in their community, as well as hang out with them at Jamboree!

During soccer practice and service-learning, there seemed to be a certain level of excitement in the air knowing that Jamboree! was only a few days away. The time the Tigers spent outside playing soccer was very free-flowing and lively, truly just playing for the love of the game. As the school year comes to an end soon, one of the second grade classes came out to practice to see what was in store for them next year as third graders when they become a part of DC SCORES.

Going into service-learning time, I was so excited to find out how their Fight 4 Fitness campaign went and check out the poster they were working on that showcased their project.

It is obvious how much these kids love to put their creative skills to use! The poster was super colorful with drawings the Tigers made of their favorite fruits and vegetables, pictures of them going out to grocery stores, and talking to their peers about the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

Their next task was to create captions for their pictures to explain what happening during that captured moment, but Coach Lee added the challenge of writing the caption in five words or fewer. It can be hard to write so little about something you love so much, but the Amidon-Bowen students crushed the challenge like always.

Everything was ready for the big day... JAMBOREE!

When I met up with the Tigers during the spring season celebration, their levels of excitement and happiness were through the roof! They were so thrilled to share their service-learning project, as well as see what the other DC SCORES teams worked on during the season.

It was such a great sight to see everyone enjoy such a truly special day. Coach Carlos, Coach Lee, and Coach Pecot looked so proud watching their team compete with other schools on the field. There was so much support from the kids as they cheered on their teammates during the games.

I will always be super grateful for the opportunity I had to work with all of the kids and the coaches that were always a pleasure to work with. My days were better whenever I had the chance to hang out at Amidon-Bowen.

There honestly could not have been a better way to wrap up spring SCORES with the Tigers. Their hard work on and off the field paid off in amazing ways by creating change in their community. Fight 4 Fitness was more than just an awareness campaign, it was the first step toward a healthier lifestyle for the rest of their lives.
