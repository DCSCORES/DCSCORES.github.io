*DC SCORES staff and Board of Directors are continually monitoring the developments surrounding COVID-19, as well as the most up-to-date procedures, practices, and guidance put forth by local, national, and international authorities. With that information top of mind, we are confidently moving forward with DC SCORES Spring Program Season. Should circumstances change or new information become available, we will adapt spring programming as appropriate to protect the health and safety of the entire SCORES family and our extended community. In the meantime, per the advice of health experts, we are encouraging all coaches and poet-athletes to take part in the day-in and day-out practicalities of staying healthy, including regular hand washing, covering coughs and sneezes, and staying home if they are ill.*

Today marks the start of another Spring SCORES season for our elementary school poet-athletes! For the next 12 weeks, thousands of kids in DC will retake the soccer field for practices and gamedays, while also spending time in the classroom to design and execute service-learning projects.




 
Every part of the program focuses on teaching kids how to implement the three DC SCORES values of teamwork, leadership, and commitment, with a continued emphasis on sportsmanship.
 
Middle School poet-athletes and Junior SCORES participants will kickoff their season next Monday, March 16th.
 
DC SCORES runs the only consistent public soccer leagues for both elementary and middle school youth in the city. Each team practices twice a week, with gamedays on Wednesdays for Junior SCORES, Thursdays for elementary schools, and Fridays for middle schools.

In addition to playing spring soccer, students at each school work together to identify an issue within their community, and then create a service-learning plan to address this issue. [Past projects](https://www.dcscores.org/blog/2019/06/making-an-impact-in-the-community-through-service-learning-projects) have included know-your-rights immigration town halls, gun violence prevention, and anti-bullying campaigns!

## Program Schedule

DC SCORES programming occurs five days a week at elementary schools (3rd-5th grade). Two days a week are designated for soccer practices and two days of service learning. On Thursdays, the poet-athletes participate in gamedays. On these days, teams play against other schools in separate boys and girls soccer games. This season, elementary school games will start on Thursday, March 26th. 
 
The middle school program (6th-8th grade) meets three days a week, but has the same amount of service hours as elementary schools. In a block scheduling format, middle schools have both soccer and service-learning two days a week and game days on Fridays. DC SCORES has a girls, boys, and a co-ed league for 28 DC Public and Public Charter middle schools thanks to a partnership with the [Public Charter School Athletic Association](https://dcchartersports.org/) (PCSAA). Middle school games begin Friday, March 27th.
 
The Junior SCORES program (1st-2nd grade) meets for practices twice a week, with bi-weekly games on Wednesdays. This program focuses on introducing kids to DC SCORES, and the values of teamwork, leadership, and commitment. Junior SCORES programs are open to grades K-2. Junior SCORES games begin Wednesday, April 1st.
