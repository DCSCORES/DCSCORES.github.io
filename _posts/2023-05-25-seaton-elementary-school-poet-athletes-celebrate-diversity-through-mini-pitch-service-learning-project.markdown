Seaton Elementary School sits on the corner of Rhode Island Avenue and 10th Street in Northwest DC, overlooking the pristine turf fields of the nearby Benjamin Banneker High School. Every day, the high school fields brim with pick-up soccer teams, but on Thursdays, the rough grass field at Seaton becomes the neighborhood’s soccer hub as DC SCORES poet-athletes and their families gather for their weekly gamedays.

There’s a lot of demand for the Seaton pitch. The school has both Junior and Elementary SCORES teams that need the field for both practice and games. What’s more, the field also serves as an extension of the playground and, since Seaton does not have a school gym, serves as a physical education classroom for the wider school community.

Space can be limited but the Seaton DC SCORES team is taking action to rectify the situation. As part of their DC SCORES service-learning project, the team is creating a brand new soccer mini-pitch at the school  in collaboration with the [US Soccer Foundation](https://ussoccerfoundation.org/programs/safe-places-to-play-mini-pitches/) and [Design FC](https://www.designfc.org/). 

The new pitch will be enclosed, with lockable storage so Seaton students can play safely. Lighting and an hard-court surface will provide a space to play into the evening and during inclement weather. “Right now, if it’s raining or something like that and the grass is wet, we can’t play on [the current field] but now it’s gonna be possible that we can still play,” says Johan, a third-grader on the Seaton DC SCORES team.

The new pitch will also create a community hub that reflects the close-knit community at Seaton by incorporating the students’ DC SCORES poetry and imagery highlighting the diverse backgrounds into the design.  “Our students are personalizing our mini-pitch,” says Seaton DC SCORES Coach Fabiana Duarte. “We’re going to have a profile to show the diversity of our kids”.

## “Safe and Secure”

Safe Place to Play Mini-Pitches is a project developed by the US Soccer Foundation (USSF), which is committed to building 1,000 new mini-pitches across the country by 2026. The Seaton project was announced by USSF as a part of the MLS all-star match, which will be played at Audi Field in July 2023. 

When USSF and Design FC approached the Seaton team, the squad immediately knew they wanted to incorporate the mini-pitch design into their service-learning project. Each spring, poet-athletes at every participating DC SCORES school create and execute a service-learning project focused on the topics they wrote about in their poetry during the fall season.

Throughout the spring season, Seaton poet-athletes participated in workshops with Design FC, an afterschool program that works with students to learn more about visual design and work together to create unique products for their soccer teams. 

The team’s goal was to ensure that the mini-pitch served the Seaton community, while also creating a safe outdoor space to play after-school. “Sometimes the park isn’t safe, there’s been shootings up there,” says 5th-grader Zoe. “We want something that's safe, parents around, people around to make sure it’s safe and secure.”

## A Celebration of Community

Though the Seaton team will use the mini-pitch for their practices and game days, the facility will be available to all Seaton students who want to play soccer. This community development aspect is one of the most appealing parts of the project for the students. “I feel happy to work on this because when we grow up and come back with our kids to DC SCORES we’ll know how much we miss it and how good we did the hard work,” says 4th-grader Jefferson Contreras Salvador. 

Long-term impact is an important pillar of the DC SCORES service learning program and one that the Seaton students take seriously.  “Everyone is going through challenges in life,” says 3rd-grader Hana. “I think we should help people in need because we may have a lot and they might not.”

The USSF mini-pitch is designed to be durable, and the Seaton facility will be used by generations of students at the school. With that lasting legacy, an important part of the design process was to put the team’s unique stamp on the project. 

“When I think about this school, I really think about diversity,” says Coach Duarte. “All kinds of people from all walks of life are here and it’s really celebrated”.

To reflect that diversity in their design, poet-athletes incorporated lines from the team’s iconic poem “Seaton’s Got That Sauce”, which won the squad  first place at the 2022 DC SCORES Westside poetry slam. The piece is a proud showcase of the multitude of ethnicities and identities held by members  of the team, featuring lines in Amharic, Spanish, and English. 

“It feels good to celebrate [diversity] because it’s just…nice,” remarks Zoe. “It doesn’t matter what country they’re from or the color of their skin, you should let everyone play.”

Being part of a legacy that brings the joy of soccer to more kids is one of the things that makes being part of the Seaton team so meaningful, says 3rd-grader Jeremiah. “I know when I’m older and I come back to Seaton and see another kid on the little mini-pitch, I’ll know that that right there, we made that,” he explains. “I love my sport.”
