On October 12, DC SCORES celebrated yet another record-breaking [One Night One Goal](https://onog.dcscores.org/home) after the event raised over $500,000 for the non-profit's soccer, poetry, and service-learning programs.

Held annually, One Night One Goal brings the District’s soccer and poetry community together for an unforgettable evening under the lights at Audi Field. One Night One Goal also broke DC SCORES fundraising records for a single event in 2022 when it [brought in more than $440,000](https://www.dcscores.org/blog/2022/10/one-night-one-goal-2022), a tally only surpassed by this year’s success.

Guests at One Night One Goal raised money for DC SCORES’ award-winning afterschool programs through ticket sales, live and silent auctions, and a live ask held in the stadium’s EagleBank Club. The event was also [generously sponsored by organizations](https://onog.dcscores.org/sponsors) including Audi, NFP, Enlightenment Capital, D.C. United, and the Washington Spirit.

"We have been hosting One Night One Goal for five years now, and every year it gets bigger and better," says Tony Francavilla, Chief Development Officer for DC SCORES. "I love watching soccer fans discover the power of poetry in our Busboys and Poets Poetry Lounge and channel that enthusiasm into incredible generosity and support.”

Attendees watched standout performances from poets including Regie Cabico and E-Baby, as well as musical artists Be Steadwell, Black Assets, Malik Dope, and Emory Diggs and Friends. Those soaking up the atmosphere in the Poetry Lounge also received a surprise treat in the form of a spoken word performance from Ashley Hatch. The Washington Spirit, U.S. national team star, and DC SCORES board member delivered a joint poem with DC SCORES Chief of Arts and Culture Charity Blackwell that explored how they navigate the world through public and private personas that sometimes appear contradictory.

“Ashley’s performance proved that we are all poet-athletes and can use our voice and platform to express ourselves and share the things we care about,” said Katrina Owens, Executive Director of DC SCORES. “It was really wonderful to see her harness words and perform with the same power she displays on the soccer field.”

Hatch also co-hosted the evening’s live auction alongside D.C. United captain Steve Birnbaum. After an opening from virtuoso drummer Malik Dope, the pair introduced one-of-a-kind auction items, including the opportunity to join D.C. United at a training session, a two-week lease of an Audi RS E-Tron GT, and a penalty kick clinic coached by Hatch.

Afterward, the two led the audience in a paddle raise where attendees pledged close to an additional $75,000, an amount that was supplemented with $25,000 donations from both D.C. United’s owners and Washington Spirit owner Michele Kang.

“The incredible success of One Night One Goal is all down to the amazing partners we are fortunate to have here at DC SCORES,” stressed Francavilla.

He added, “Without our sponsors, and our deep roots within both the soccer and poetry communities in DC, we would never be able to offer this unique event. We are so grateful to everyone who makes One Night One Goal such a big success every year, and helps us continue to work toward our goal of ensuring that DC SCORES is available to every child in the District who needs our program.”
