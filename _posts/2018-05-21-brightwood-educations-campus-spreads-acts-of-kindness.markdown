This Spring at [Brightwood Education Campus](http://www.brightwoodec.org/) sixth, seventh and eighth graders are learning how to spread acts of kindness throughout their school as their service learning project.

Through the [service learning ](https://www.dcscores.org/our-program/program-model/)component of the [DC SCORES](https://www.dcscores.org/) program, Brightwood DC SCORES students are learning how to give back to their school community through the arts, poetry and service-learning.

Students are researching how to promote acts of kindness in their community by creating a paper tree that will have acts of kindness written on the leaves that students can take part in. The tree will be displayed in the school hallways. They will also make acts of kindness announcements and flyers and posters to share with their classmates.

Lead by DC SCORES writing coach, Belinda Omenitsch, students are taught how to engage in leadership and creativity skills that otherwise would not have been gained on the soccer field but through the arts and service learning.

Tatiana, 12, a DC SCORES students says “my favorite part of the program is that we learn how to be better at being kind to each other”.

Students are able to translate their sportsmanship and teamwork skills they have learned on the field in the classroom among their classmates.

“We’ve gotten a few ESL (English as a Second Language) students who are in the program. I have been able to see them grow as students, as team members and as community members. They \[the students\] have really come out of their shell” says Ms. Belinda Omenitsch.

On Tuesday, May 22nd , Brightwood students will have the opportunity to attend the [6th Annual Congressional Soccer Match](https://ussoccerfoundation.org/events/congressional-soccer-match) held at Gonzaga College High School as ball girls.

This exciting occasion celebrates the end of a successful Spring 2018 service learning program at the school and marks a vibrant future for the DC SCORES program at Brightwood Education Campus.
