A soccer player places a ball on the penalty spot, breathes deeply, and shouts “Let’s go!” before striking cleanly into the back of the net. This isn’t a highlight from a World Cup match, but the thrilling final shot of a [slick commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxKmUXo8u_g) that places America SCORES poet-athletes at the center of this year’s biggest soccer story.

Through an advertisement spot donated by World Cup 2022 broadcaster FOX Sports, America SCORES — an umbrella network of 11 SCORES cities serving more than 11,000 kids across the United States and Canada — is spreading the word about a new generation of poet-athletes who are poised to have a transformative impact on their local communities.

The 30-second spot, which follows a poet-athlete as they prepare for a poetry slam and a big soccer match, was developed pro bono by [creative agency Artemis Ward](https://artemisward.com/) and features DC SCORES participants, alumni, and coaches.

“\[QUOTE,\]” said Colin Moffett, Managing Partner at Artemis Ward.

FOX Sports has been a donor to the America SCORES New York affiliate since the summer of 2020. When John Riordan, Chief Development Officer at America SCORES New York, received an offer in September for a different kind of support from the broadcaster — to participate in an initiative offering free advertising space to grassroots soccer organizations — he knew he couldn’t turn down the opportunity.

“This is potentially a five-year opportunity for the current Men's World Cup, next year's Women's World Cup, and then of course the hosting of the next Men's World Cup on our doorsteps in 2026,” Riordan explained. “The potential for our entire network to benefit in multiple ways was boundless if we approached it the right way.”

With the World Cup just weeks away, Riordan reached out to his colleagues across the SCORES network for recommendations for a creative agency that could help at short notice. Riordan’s counterpart at DC SCORES, Anthony Francavilla, knew just who to call.

“The folks at Artemis Ward have worked with us for years, they’ve attended slams and other events — they get SCORES! Add to that the fact that they are such a talented and accomplished agency, it was a no-brainer,” said Francavilla, who contacted the agency to ask if they would like to take on the project.

Artemis Ward were immediately on board, offering their services pro bono and gathering a team together to develop a concept for the spot as rapidly as possible. “\[QUOTE\],” recalled Moffett.

The Artemis Ward team proposed that the ad focus on the holistic nature of the SCORES program, with the commercial initially leading the audience to believe they are following two students, a soccer player and a poet, before the camera pans to reveal that they are the same person: a poet-athlete.

“I had chills. There's a lot of power in being a poet-athlete, and in building a generation of poet-athletes, so seeing such a polished piece put the poet-athlete front and center blew me away. I couldn't wait for folks to see it,” said Francavilla.

## A DC Effort

With the clock ticking ever closer toward the World Cup’s opening games, Artemis Ward and DC SCORES quickly organized a day’s shoot at Cardozo Education Campus and Event DC’s Fields at RFK Campus. Poet-athletes and coaches from Cardozo were featured in the commercial, alongside the ad’s star, Mariame Traore, an alumni of the DC SCORES team at Leckie Education Campus.

Members of the DC community were also instrumental behind the camera. DC SCORES Senior Advisor for Arts and Culture Charity Blackwell worked closely with Artemis Ward to write the poem featured in the commercial, while Brandon Bloch, Founding Partner at [Hometeam](https://wearehometeam.com/our-work) — a global remote production company that connects brands and agencies with locally-based video producers — helped Artemis Ward to engage DC-based production company [Run Riot Films](http://www.runriotfilms.com/) and [local director Brandon Bray](http://decade.is/) to shoot the ad.

“\[QUOTE\],” said Moffett.

The commercial — which is now in rotation on FOX Sports, FOX Desportes FS1, and FS2 — builds on the international attention America SCORES gained when U.S. Soccer Federation partner Volkswagen donated their 2019 Women’s World Cup ad space to the organization. [The 2019 advertisement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkXahQmlXow) featured a video montage of America SCORES programming and was also set to an original poem by Blackwell.

“Our 2022 ad really captures the ‘all in one’ nature of our work,” said America SCORES Executive Director Icy Jones. “Our students build teams on the soccer field, explore issues that impact their communities in their poetry, and work together on their service-learning projects to do good in their neighborhoods.”

“We’re excited to introduce more people to our work through this ad and are grateful to FOX, Artemis Ward, and the many people who came together to help make it a reality,” he added.

Viewers can watch the 2022 advertisement between World Cup matches on FOX Sports, FOX Deportes, FS1, and FS2 for the duration of the tournament. Learn more about America SCORES at [americascores.org](https://www.americascores.org/).
