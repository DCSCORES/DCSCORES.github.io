To mark the 20th anniversary, captains of teams that have played in the tournament throughout its two-decade history were presented with a commemorative jersey drawing on 90s aesthetics and artifacts from the first-ever tournament.

“The tournament was really big this year, and we had a ton of new teams join and experience the fun and competitive atmosphere for the first time,” says Danny Sheerin, Senior Programs Manager, who was one of the lead organizers for SCORES Cup. “For a huge chunk of players, that day is the first introduction they have to learn more about our kids and our program. It’s always awesome when they ask how they can get more involved and see our kids in action throughout the year.”
