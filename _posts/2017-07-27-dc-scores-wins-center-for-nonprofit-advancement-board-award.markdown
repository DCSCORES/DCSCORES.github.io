For the second straight month, the Center for Nonprofit Advancement chose DC SCORES for a distinguished award validating the leadership and structure of the after-school program.

At an event Thursday morning, DC SCORES received the [Board Leadership Award](https://www.nonprofitadvancement.org/BoardLeadership) for nonprofits with a budget under $2 million. The award "was developed with support from area experts to recognize and spotlight outstanding leadership from Boards of Directors of Washington-area nonprofit organizations."


In June, the Center [chose DC SCORES](https://www.dcscores.org/blog/2017/06/awards-day-dc-scores-wins-twice-in-one-morning) for its prestigious Advancement in Management (AIM) Award -- a definitive stamp of approval for the way an organization is run from top to bottom. Now, this honor highlights the success of DC SCORES' Board of Directors (see our leadership page [HERE](https://www.dcscores.org/about-us/leadership/)).
