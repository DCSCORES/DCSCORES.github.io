The 15th Annual DC SCORES Cup lived up to its billing as the largest in the tournament's history.

With more than 10 new companies in the mix, 40 teams participated in the DC area's largest corporate charity soccer tournament and raised $170,000 in support of DC SCORES. The 40 teams was eight more than the previous record number of participating companies and law firms.


On what turned out to be a beautiful, sunny Saturday, more than 600 people of various soccer skill levels and ages played 112 soccer games across 10 fields at the Maryland SoccerPlex in Germantown, Md. The teams were split into four brackets, giving each company a catered experience.

Those into being super competitive got their wish, with **Clark Construction** winning the division. **Grant Thornton** took home the new Intermediate Division championship. **Capital for Children** won the Casual Division. And **Arnold & Porter Kay Scholer** was victorious in the first year of the Law Firms Division.

A big thank you to **Subway**, which sponsored lunch for the second consecutive year. **DrinkMore Water** provided all the hydration needed. And **KRƒÅ** electrolyte drinks provided free samples throughout the afternoon and cases of its replenishing beverage to the teams who pushed on to the playoffs -- playing their sixth or even seventh game.

**D.C. United** mascot Talon made an appearance, walking the grounds and posing for photos with the teams. And thanks to DC's Major League Soccer team -- which also brought a staff team to the Cup -- every participant received a ticket to the July 22 D.C. United game which will be preceded by a large DC SCORES tailgate, too.

From the legacy teams that have participated in every DC SCORES Cup -- **Marriott, Hogan Lovells US LLP** and **Zuckerman Spaeder LLP** -- to the new teams, the 15th version of the event was the most successful ever as DC's most prominent soccer tournament for charity continues to grow.

We look forward to 2018!
