This year, DC SCORES is offering four free summer camps for rising second-graders to rising ninth-graders. 

From today, June 18, until July 27, kids will participate in activities geared toward keeping their bodies and minds active during the summer break. 

DC SCORES is hosting four camps in various parts of DC to serve more kids this summer than ever before with two soccer-specific camps and two soccer and arts camps! 

Summer SCORES kicks off today at [JC Nalle Elementary School](https://www.google.com/maps/place/J+C+Nalle+Community+School/@38.8859102,-76.9308836,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x894ed23eac93b885!8m2!3d38.8859102!4d-76.9308836) in SE with a week of soccer activities and fun! On June 25, our other three camps kick off at [Tubman Elementary School](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tubman+Elementary+School/@38.92886,-77.0314122,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89b7c81ef18d2a51:0xc1d3f456c3c763e6!8m2!3d38.92886!4d-77.0292235) in NW, [Truesdell Education Campus](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Truesdell+Education+Campus/@38.9539256,-77.0266045,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89b7c86fb1b2d9dd:0x124f9e35509909d1!8m2!3d38.9539256!4d-77.0244158) in NW, and [Leckie Education Campus](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Leckie+Elementary+School/@38.8281535,-77.0153099,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89b7b711e92c99b3:0x4bb5fc6f03e4b512!8m2!3d38.8281535!4d-77.0131212) in SW.

All camps are FREE! The two soccer-specific camps at JC Nalle and Tubman are eligible for rising third- to rising ninth-graders. The two, five-week soccer and arts camps at Truesdell and Leckie are eligible for rising second- to rising sixth-graders. These camps are a great opportunity for kids that are not full-year DC SCORES poet-athletes to experience one of the most enriching summer camps in the city!

We strive to create a fun and welcoming environment for kids, and all camps are led by expert coaches and counselors who are trained in soccer and positive youth development. We provide each participant with a t-shirt and at least one meal every day of camp. 

Additionally, the camps bring kids together from different parts of the city -- building long-lasting friendships and exposing participants to different cultures. 

The summer months are a critical period for low-income youth due to their [lack of activity](https://www.summerlearning.org/at-a-glance/) when not in school. Kids that don't have the resources to attend traditional summer camps often struggle with learning loss once classes resume. DC SCORES offers a solution to this issue by giving kids the confidence and skills to succeed on the playing field, in the classroom, and in life.
