The trend continues.

In an annual tradition, the DC SCORES Cup set a record for number of teams and funds raised to support our poet-athletes. The rain also held off despite a nebulous forecast, making for an impeccable day of soccer.

On Saturday, June 23, **46 teams and more than 700 participants** representing highly respected companies and law firms from the greater Washington, DC, area converged on the Maryland SoccerPlex in Gaithersburg, Md., for the 16th Annual DC SCORES Cup presented by [Cuisine Solutions](https://www.cuisinesolutions.com/).

Men and women wearing different colored shirts with their logos on the back played in more than 100 games across six fields. It was nonstop action from 8:30am-5:30pm. The tournament culminated with four champions, including three first-time winners who did it in their first year - **PWC Public Sector** (Casual Division), **Wells Fargo** (Intermediate Division), **Arnold & Porter** (Law Division) and **World Bank** (Competitive Division).

But everyone had a great time. When teams broke between games, participants enjoyed both breakfast and then lunch options from Cuisine Solutions; visited the **D.C. United** and **Washington Spirit** tents to learn more about our local professional teams; and then walked over to a hill where a jumbotron showed the three World Cup games throughout the day. Entertainment was everywhere.

Everyone stayed hydrated thanks to longtime supporter **DrinkMore Water**, and Cuisine Solutions had food for recharging throughout the cloudy (then sun-soaked) day. A big thanks to all 46 participating companies and firms (including multiple-team entries!).
