Every kid deserves to be a part of a team and thanks to **YOU**, more kids in DC get that opportunity.





On **Giving Tuesday** (November 27), **[a donation to DC SCORES](http://bit.ly/DCSgivingtuesday)** goes a long way toward giving DC SCORES poet-athletes the opportunity to succeed on the playing field, in the classroom, and in life.

**$25:** Provides transportation for a kid to travel to soccer tournaments and Poetry Slam

**$50:** A microphone so a poet-athlete can use their voice and power on stage

**$100:** Provides one poet-athlete with soccer equipment and writing supplies for one year

**$300:** Provides soccer jerseys for an entire team with their school’s name on the back

We know that all of these opportunities are possible thanks to every single one of our donors. That's why we want to thank all of our Giving Tuesday supporters in real time in a list below.

We've said it a lot, but we'll keep on saying it – THANK YOU!
