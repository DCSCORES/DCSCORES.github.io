The backbone of DC SCORES is soccer and now more than ever, we’re committed to getting our neighborhood teams together again as safely as possible. On May 19th, we hope you can team up with us and [support the work of DC SCORES](https://bit.ly/DCSgive) as we continue to bring our teams of poet-athletes back together in-person again.





DC SCORES has adapted incredibly during the COVID-19 pandemic to meet the needs of kids in the District. Today is the day to support our efforts as we adapt to bring back in-person programming in a safe and equitable manner to thousands of kids.

Soccer practices may not *look* like they used to (masks, physical distancing, lots of hand sanitizer, etc.), but DC SCORES is making sure they *feel* like they used to for every kid that participates. 

**The goal is to raise at least $10,000** within 24 hours to help bring kids back on the field! Any amount makes the difference!

This year during our Spring Day of Giving, your support means DOUBLE! All donations to DC SCORES today will be matched by [T-Rex Solutions](https://www.trexsolutionsllc.com/) up to $10,000.

* **$10: Stay game day ready** – Socks and shin guards are essential for poet-athletes to perform their best and be safe on the field.

* **$25: Eliminate barriers to play** – Transportation is a determining factor in providing a poet-athlete the opportunity to play in a soccer tournament.

* **$50: Bring kids back on the field safely** – Safety is the #1 priority as we return to the field and that requires PPE for every kid and coach so they can enjoy in-person practices with their team.

* **$100: Create year-round opportunities** – Supplies for a full year of soccer and writing can allow a poet-athlete to experience the joys of sports, arts, service, and being part of a team.

* **$300: Support a team’s confidence on the field** – Matching uniforms can transform a team and improve the confidence of poet-athletes.

* **$500: Empower a teammate** – One full season of DC SCORES for a poet-athlete can be transformational in the classroom and on the field.
