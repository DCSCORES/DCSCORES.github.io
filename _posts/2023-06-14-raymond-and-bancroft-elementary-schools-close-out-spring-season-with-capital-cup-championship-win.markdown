The wet weather couldn’t dampen the spirits of poet-athletes at Raymond and Bancroft Elementary Schools who lifted the girls’ and boys’ trophies during rainswept DC SCORES Capital Cup championship games on June 12.

Raymond Elementary School’s DC SCORES girls’ team wore custom-made jerseys for the final, where they beat title defenders Houston Elementary School 4-1. The Raymond girls’ team has been an unstoppable force this season, remaining undefeated and beating out DC SCORES powerhouse Seaton Elementary School in the semi-finals.

Celebrating immediately after the girls’ win, members of the Raymond boys’ squad — many of them sporting their own championship jerseys from their own run to the Capital Cup final in 2021 — joined their teammates for the trophy presentation. Also present were representatives from Pepco, which sponsors the Raymond team and has cheered on the squad at every major DC SCORES game and event this season.

Accepting their second-place medals, the girls’ squad from Houston Elementary School recognized another successful season for the team. It has placed in the poetry slam and made it to the Capital Cup final each year since it joined the program in 2021.

Despite the looming storm clouds, Bancroft Elementary School defeated Bishop Walker School for Boys 4-2 in the boys’ final. The squads were evenly matched during the first three quarters of play, with every Bancroft goal followed swiftly by a Bishop Walker equalizer. However, two goals from Bancroft in the last five minutes secured the trophy for the Westside team.

Bancroft lifted the Capital Cup silverware, and a replica of the World Cup trophy, minutes before a thunderstorm forced players and spectators back in their buses and cars. However, the inclement weather did not stop families and teachers from all four schools from attending the finals to cheer on their teams.

“Capital Cup is always one of my favorite events of the season,” said Will Sutton, Program Director for Leagues at DC SCORES. “The teamwork and heart our poet-athletes show on the pitch as their family members and friends cheer them on from the sidelines is what DC SCORES is all about.”
