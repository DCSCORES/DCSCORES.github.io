In order to serve more kids in the District, DC SCORES expanded its program to include K-2 graders and teach the core values of teamwork, leadership and commitment at a younger age.
 
Junior SCORES currently serves over 250 kids, ages 5-8, and offers age-appropriate soccer activities with a social-emotional skill development component. DC SCORES is able to offer this opportunity completely **free of charge** to our participants thanks to people like you who contribute on days like Do More 24. 




 
Our goal is to expand Junior SCORES programming so more kids can be a part of a team earlier on in life. Junior SCORES offers our youngest kids the chance to get started working with a team, building confidence and learning fundamental soccer skills. It creates an early pipeline for kids into our programming, so they can start their time in elementary school off with a supportive after-school community where they can create lasting, impactful relationships with classmates and coaches that will carry on throughout the years.
