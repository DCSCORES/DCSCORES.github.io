**Can you tell us about yourself?**
My name is Veronica Telzmov. I’m 9 years old, and I attend SWWFS. I have been in DC SCORES since I was 9 years old. When I grow up I want to be a teacher and make desserts at home for fun.

**What are your hobbies?**
Soccer, poetry, taekwondo, ballet, piano, reading, cooking/baking, listening to music, arts and crafts 

**What do you love most about performing your poetry?**
I love saying things in poems cause people don’t judge what you say, they listen. 

**What are your favorite things to write about?**
I love to write about things that I want to change. For example, shootings, global warming, trash. Also, sometimes I just write about random things. 

**Who are your biggest supporters and why?**
My biggest supporters are my mom and my dad because they want me to try new things and since I’m really good at it I think that they would want me to keep doing it.
