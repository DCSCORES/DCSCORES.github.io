On Thursday, poet-athletes and coaches at Thomas Elementary School honored Arianna Davis by dedicating their DC SCORES fall season to the [10-year-old taken too soon earlier this year](https://www.dcscores.org/blog/2023/05/dc-scores-statement-on-the-passing-of-arianna-davis-and-jefferson-luna-perez). 

Arianna was a member of the Thomas DC SCORES team and affectionately known as “Junior Coach” because of her dedication to the school’s Junior SCORES poet-athletes. She passed away on May 17 after sustaining wounds from stray bullets while driving home from Mother’s Day celebrations with her family. 

The Thomas team gathered before their first game of the 2023 DC SCORES fall season to release balloons in Arianna’s favorite colors and celebrate her life with cupcakes arranged in the shape of a 10, Arianna’s jersey number. The team also debuted new DC SCORES kits with an “AD #10” crest, which they will wear throughout the season.

“Arianna was, and always will be, a member of the DC SCORES family,” said Katrina Owens, Executive Director of DC SCORES. She continued, “She should have been sharing the excitement of the first game of the DC SCORES season with her friends. Instead, with her family, they are mourning her loss.”

“DC SCORES extends our deepest condolences to all of Arianna’s loved ones and joins the wider Thomas community in demanding an end to gun violence in DC,” Owens added. She said, “We will never forget Arianna’s legacy as a supportive and dedicated member of her team, and we know that the Thomas team will honor her memory this season by playing with the heart and motivation that she demonstrated in life.”
