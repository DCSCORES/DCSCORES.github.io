As the summer is slowly coming to an end and we get closer to the start of another **Fall SCORES season** (starting September 9), we thought it would be a good idea to look back on the incredible [summer SCORES](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dcscorespictures/albums/72157709535567637) season we had!





To start off, is it really summertime without camp? DC SCORES provided two, free [soccer and arts camps](https://www.dcscores.org/blog/2019/06/free-soccer-and-arts-camps-during-summer-scores) to rising 2nd-6th grade boys and girls at **Truesdell Education Campus** and **Leckie Education Campus**. These five weeks of camps were jam-packed with fun and stimulating soccer and arts activities for the campers to enjoy. 

For arts programming, outside experts lead sessions on different topics every week, ranging from dance, painting, drumming, and more.

In addition to all the activities happening at Truesdell and Leckie, campers had weekly field trips to new and interesting areas around D.C. Whether is was seeing the pandas at the **National Zoo**, checking out the new exhibits at the **National Building Museum**, or getting a behind-the-scenes look at **Audi Field**, every week was a new adventure.

What made this summer stand out from past summers was the international and world-renowned friends we made along the way.

It all started with [Real Betis stopping by Amidon-Bowen Elementary School](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dcscorespictures/albums/72157708759851352) in late May for a soccer clinic. The fun our poet-athletes had there clearly transcended Europe and peaked the interest of teams from **Ligue 1** and the **Premier League** that followed suit. 

[Saint-Étienne](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dcscorespictures/albums/72157709703154216) from France hosted some of our middle school poet-athletes and alumni at **RFK Stadium** for an elite practice and training session with their first-team technical staff. Our kids also witnessed the first-team’s practice to learn some of their French techniques. 

Later in July, [Arsenal stopped by the Truesdell](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dcscorespictures/albums/72157709819864876) to surprise campers and partake in the various activities that day. The art topic of the week was dance, and Arsenal players did not back down when their opportunity came to show what other skills they had off the field.

Finally, a couple of female poet-athletes from Brightwood Education Campus and some of our coaches held a [soccer clinic with the help of New Balance](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dcscorespictures/albums/72157710310372686) with special guest and World Cup champion, **Rose Lavelle**!

Every summer is a memorable one for DC SCORES as we strive to give all of our kids the best experience possible, and this summer in particular we hope was one they’ll never forget!
