In the State of Qatar, [National Sport Day](http://portal.www.gov.qa/wps/portal/about-qatar/nationalsportday) is celebrated on the second Tuesday of February. This day is celebrated by encouraging everyone to participate in sporting activities with family and friends.

This is the third year DC SCORES celebrated the day by hosting “Winter Sports Day” for schools that participate in winter SCORES programming. What set this year apart is that two other [America SCORES affiliates](http://www.americascores.org/affiliates) participated as well in New York City and Los Angeles! Here's a recap of the events in the three cities.

Almost 150 poet-athletes from Harlem and Washington Heights brought excitement to the Sofive Soccer Complex in the Meadowlands for the inaugural National America SCORES Winter Sports Day sponsored by the Embassy of the State of Qatar.

ASNY Executive Director Shannon Schneeman launched the event and welcomed our new Qatari friends before introducing His Excellency Nasser Ibrahim Mohammed Allanqawi, the Consul General of the State of Qatar in New York.

The Consul General addressed students and coaches about the importance of sports for health and fitness and told the poet-athletes that in Qatar everyone would be playing just like them.

"It was an incredible day,” said Ms. Schneeman. “ The kids really enjoyed the opportunity to play at this amazing venue and we are grateful to the Embassy of the State of Qatar and the Consulate General in New York for making this all possible."

The LA SCORES inaugural Winter Sports Day event sponsored by the Embassy of Qatar USA and the Consulate General of the State of Qatar in Los Angeles was a huge success!

Over 100 students enrolled in the LA SCORES Junior SCORES program at Palms Elementary School, Charnock Road Elementary School and Braddock Drive Elementary School participated in the event. The kids spent the afternoon at Mar Vista Park to enjoy soccer activities and games with the LA SCORES coaching team.

The event was attended by dignitaries from the office of the Consulate General of the State of Qatar in Los Angeles, and approximately 100 parents and volunteers. Each child received a soccer ball, t-shirt and water bottle as part of the event.

A Facebook Live video report was provided by [Hoy Deportes Los Angeles, ](http://www.hoylosangeles.com/deportes/)including an interview with LA SCORES alumnus and current LA SCORES Site Coordinator at Braddock Drive Elementary, Miguel Aquino.

The third annual Winter Sports Day kicked off at the Total Sports Arena to host more than 200 DC SCORES poet-athletes from 13 different schools this past Tuesday.

During an afternoon full of activities, the poet-athletes had a great time learning about a new culture and their traditions by writing their name in Arabic and trying some delicious Middle Eastern cuisine.

On a day that’s meant to celebrate sports, our poet-athletes couldn’t help but invite some of the representatives from the Embassy of the State of Qatar for a soccer game. Let’s be honest, what’s a DC SCORES event without a kids vs adults game?

DC SCORES is happy to be able to host an event, at the conclusion of the Winter SCORES season, that celebrates the importance of sports in the daily lives of our poet-athletes.

All of these individual celebrations would not have been possible without the sponsorship of the Embassy of the State of Qatar. Thank you for making America SCORES Winter Sports Day a reality for so many kids!
