*From dance parties to raffles for DC SCORES merchandise, every World Cup watch party has been a huge hit.*












As any World Cup manager will tell you, teamwork pays off. This month, that maxim has been especially true for DC SCORES, which has joined forces with numerous partners across DC to capitalize on World Cup fever and raise money for its soccer, poetry, and service-learning programs.

Through watch parties, merchandise activations, and collaborations with partners all over the city, the nonprofit has been raising awareness, and dollars, for its programs serving more than 3,000 kids across the District.

“This year's World Cup has been great for us to get into the community and partner with local businesses,” said Yasmin Ibrahim, Associate Director of Individual Giving at DC SCORES, who led the organization’s World Cup activations. “It has been really cool to bring different groups together over the last month to watch matches and share more about DC SCORES with them.  I'm so glad we're able to share our love for the sport and our programs with our local community while supporting our young poet-athletes.”

## An International Affair: Watch Parties at Wundergarten

As the tournament moved into the final matches of group stage play, fans across the world came out in force to cheer on their national teams as they competed for a spot in the round of 16. In DC – a hub city of international diplomacy – local embassies held watch parties for expats and locals alike to show their support for the teams in the tournament.

On November 29, DC SCORES joined the British Embassy and the Welsh Government at Wundergarten for a watch party for the England vs. Wales match. The historic rivalry between the two UK home nations was amped up as England sought to secure first place in the group and Wales attempted to avoid elimination from the competition. The bar was also home to USA and Iran fans, who showed up for a District Sports-held watch party for the highly anticipated match between the two nations.

Drink specials for the afternoon included a $1 donation to DC SCORES for every Atlas beer purchased, which attendees could outfit with a branded DC SCORES koozie. And, if guests were in the mood for additional free swag, they could pick up even more merchandise from another SCORES partner in attendance — the Washington Spirit!

## Dancing for DC SCORES: All-Day metrobar Party

For the tournament's first Round of 16 matches on December 3, DC SCORES teamed up with local DJs and the Washington Spirit for an all-day party at metrobar. The morning kicked off with a USA vs. Netherlands watch party, where Washington Spirit players Anna Heilferty and Aubrey Kingsbury cheered on their fellow pros.

*The double-header Round of 16 matches were followed up by a night of dancing and DC SCORES raffles.*

In the afternoon, soccer fans turned out for the Argentina vs. Australia despite the disappointment of the United States’ elimination from the tournament. After the final whistle at 4PM, DJ sets from Mazlow, K. JIbbs, dagher, and RESONANT helped the event transition to the dancefloor, with partygoers raising money for DC SCORES through an exclusive raffle.

“Soccer and music are two of my greatest passions in life. As a kid, the field was one of the only places where I didn’t have to grow up too fast. As an adult, I’ve found the same freedom of self-expression on the dance floor and behind the decks,” said DJ Mazlow, who organized the DJ set as a fundraiser for DC SCORES. “The sanctuary and empowerment that I found in soccer and the arts is a privilege that many kids do not have access to. DC SCORES recognizes that and is actively working to change it.”

## Mundial Month with District Sports

Throughout the tournament, long-time DC SCORES partner District Sports has been hosting World Cup watch parties benefitting DC SCORES. District Sports, a nonprofit which organizes adult soccer leagues across DC, held their flagship “Pack the Hall” series at Hook Hall for USA games. The events were sold-out affairs where all proceeds support SCORES programming.

District Sports support extended beyond the USA matches, too, with their [Mundial Month](https://districtsportssoccer.org/home-slider/mundialmonth/) campaign engaging soccer fans’ love of the World Cup through watch parties and brackets supporting DC SCORES and other local nonprofits.

## Building New Relationships with Tin Shop Restaurant Group

The tournament also presented new partnership opportunities. DC SCORES teamed up with Tin Shop Restaurant Group for the first time to host watch parties at bars around the DMV throughout the World Cup. As part of the new collaboration, Tin Shop bars offered drink specials supporting DC SCORES with every purchase.

## Poet-Athlete Pepco Watch Party

DC SCORES poet-athletes have also been part of the World Cup excitement! SCORES partner Pepco invited the Raymond Elementary School DC SCORES team to watch the quarterfinal match between Morocco vs. Portugal for a watch party at Edison Photo Gallery that included small-sided indoor soccer, a popcorn machine, and DC SCORES merchandise.

*Raymond Elementary School poet-athletes cheered on both sides during the match.*

“Our friends at Pepco turned their Edison Place Gallery into an awesome watch party venue, complete with games, popcorn, pizza, cupcakes, swag and more.” said Anthony Francavilla, Chief Development Officer at DC SCORES. “Our poet-athletes had a blast, and got to bring their families along for the fun as well! Pepco sponsored our Poetry Slams this year, so with the watch parties they’ve really got both sides of the poet-athlete covered!”
