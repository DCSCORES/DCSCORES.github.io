The new year is here and so is DC SCORES! The **Winter SCORES** season officially starts today for our four participating sites.

It’s been a long two months since the [Fall SCORES season](https://www.dcscores.org/blog/2018/09/as-august-comes-to-an-end-the-fall-scores-season-quickly-begins) ended in November so DC SCORES is glad to be back for a new season filled with soccer and nutrition.

Winter SCORES consists of a **six-week, scaled-down nutrition and soccer program** that will take place this season at [LaSalle Education Campus - Elementary](https://www.lasallebackus.org/), [Seaton Elementary School](https://seatondc.org/), [Truesdell Education Campus-Elementary](https://www.facebook.com/truesdellec/), and [Lincoln Middle School](https://checdc.org/).

Poet-athletes will learn about the importance of properly fueling their bodies to perform their best on the field. Each student will get the opportunity to prepare healthy snacks and see for themselves the difference proper nutrition can make for an athlete during soccer clinics.

Winter programming aims to get kids thinking about the choices they make when it comes to nutrition and showcase the importance of combining exercise with nutrition for a healthy lifestyle. Participating poet-athletes get the opportunity to learn about nutrition in a fun way with hands-on activities and cooking sessions.

The curriculum, partially provided by [Common Threads](http://www.commonthreads.org/), covers a wide range of topics aiming to empower our poet-athletes to make healthier conscious eating choices. Each lesson will address a specific topic such as reading nutrition labels, serving size, food origins and drinks.
