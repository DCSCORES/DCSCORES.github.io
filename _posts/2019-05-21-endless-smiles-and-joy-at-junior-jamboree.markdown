**Audi Field** has been the home of many DC SCORES events since it opened its gates last July, but it’s fair to say that Junior Jamboree is the most adorable celebration the stadium hosted thus far.





To conclude the first full year of Junior SCORES, what better way to wrap up the [Spring SCORES season](https://www.dcscores.org/blog/2019/03/goodbye-winter-hello-spring-scores) for the Juniors than by playing on the same pitch where **Wayne Rooney** and **Lucho Acosta** work their magic.

For those that are not familiar with [Junior SCORES](https://parents.dcscores.org/programs/junior-scores), this new programming open to K-2 graders at 12 of the [69 DC SCORES sites](https://www.dcscores.org/our-program/program-sites/), is school or recreation center based, team-based, and serves the whole child. Junior SCORES focuses on introducing kids to soccer and DC SCORES' values of teamwork, leadership, and commitment at a young age so they can build interest in the sport and gain an early understanding of the power of being part of a team.

In true DC SCORES Jamboree style, soccer wasn’t the only thing in store for the over 250 Junior SCORES athletes who joined together in southwest D.C. for the first-ever Junior Jamboree. Besides showing their skills on the field, the Juniors enjoyed various arts & crafts activities, including the beloved face painting booth.

The energy levels of all the participants remained at a consistent level thanks to [Levy](www.levyrestaurants.com/), who provided Junior SCORES athletes, coaches and family members with delicious treats and drinks during the event. 

At any moment during Junior Jamboree, you could look around and see nothing but endless joy all around from everyone that was there. Whether on the field, eating lunch or at a booth, all anyone could see were smiles on people’s faces.

This event was possible in large part thanks to our official community partner, [D.C. United](https://www.dcscores.org/about-us/dc-united/), for opening the gates of Audi Field once again for our participants, coaches and families!
