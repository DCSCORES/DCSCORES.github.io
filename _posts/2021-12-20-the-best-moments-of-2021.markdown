As the start of a new year approaches, this time offers a unique opportunity to look back on what the soon-to-be old year brought for DC SCORES. 

While we all continue to navigate the ongoing challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, we can also recognize the successes and uplifting moments that 2021 brought as well. One thing that’s been constant is DC SCORES’ mission of creating neighborhood teams that give kids the confidence and skills to succeed on the playing field, in the classroom, and in life.





Our biggest success this year is without a doubt returning to in-person programming for the over 3,000 kids that we serve in D.C. annually. Distance-learning provided unique opportunities that we didn’t consider previously, but having kids reunited with their teammates and coaches is without a doubt what brings the most joy for our poet-athletes. 

We aren’t sure what 2022 will bring, but we’re optimistic about the future and DC SCORES will continue working hard for kids in the District.

**From December 20-3, join us in counting down our 10 favorite moments of 2021 (in no particular order)!**

Our official community partner (and **2021 NWSL Champions**!!), the [Washington Spirit](https://washingtonspirit.com/) really showed up big time for our poet-athletes this year.

[Golden Boot winner, Ashley Hatch](https://justwomenssports.com/washington-spirits-ashley-hatch-wins-nwsl-golden-boot/), organized a special **“Boots from Pros”** program to donate soccer cleats to many of our female poet-athletes. For many players that look up to the Spirit players as role models, receiving these boots was a very emotional moment.

In the sticky, humid days of the summer, Spirit players still prioritized coming out to our DC SCORES summer camps to spend some time and even play a little pick-up game. The summer campers at **Leckie Education Campus** were ecstatic when [Ashley Hatch](https://twitter.com/ash_hatch33) and [Chinyelu Asher](https://twitter.com/ChinyeluAsher) showed up on their last day of camp celebration.Besides showing up for summer camp, many players and their [mascot PK](https://twitter.com/PK_WashSpirit) surprised our elementary school poet-athletes at [Fall Frenzy](https://bit.ly/ff21photos) in October. 

While the Spirit love the soccer side of our programming, they are also great supporters of the poetry side. During our [Poetry Slam Watch Parties](https://bit.ly/dcswpphotos) in December, Spirit player [Paige Nielsen](https://twitter.com/Paigenielsen) and President of Business Operations [Ben Olsen](https://www.instagram.com/benolsen_14/), both made it out to **Seaton Elementary School** and **Kimball Elementary School** respectively to present the Poetry Slam winners with their trophies!

Our poet-athletes are always in awe when professional soccer players get to spend time with them and answer their many, many questions about what their experience is like. We’re extremely grateful for the Washington Spirit supporting DC SCORES during the ongoing pandemic and an amazing championship-winning season!

## 1. Fall Frenzy

One of the most missed parts of our program for poet-athletes and their families was our annual events. Not only do our events offer a fun opportunity for teams to bond in a festive atmosphere, they also showcase how every poet-athlete is part of a bigger community that expands across nearly every ward in DC.

[The Fields at RFK Campus](https://rfkfields.com/) hosted an array of events this season for our poet-athletes and supporters. October was a jam-packed soccer extravaganza with [Junior Frenzy](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dcscorespictures/albums/72157720066464355) on October 13th for over 250 1st and 2nd graders, and [Fall Frenzy](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dcscorespictures/albums/72157720067097403) on October 23rd for more than 500 3rd-5th graders from over 30 schools. Both soccer tournaments and community festivals hosted all of our elementary school teams and their families for fun-filled days that everyone could enjoy.

For Fall Frenzy, in particular, it’s impossible to talk about the success of the event without recognizing our extraordinary volunteers and supporters that showed up to make sure every field had a referee, every activity booth was enthusiastically managed, and every attendee received a meal throughout the day. Special shoutout to [EagleBank](https://www.eaglebankcorp.com/) (event sponsor), [Bethesda Soccer Club](https://www.bethesdasoccer.org/), [Penya Barcelonista Washington DC](https://fcbarcelonadc.com/), [D.C. United](https://www.dcunited.com/), [Washington Spirit](https://washingtonspirit.com/), and every single volunteer that made Fall Frenzy a memorable experience for our poet-athletes and families.
