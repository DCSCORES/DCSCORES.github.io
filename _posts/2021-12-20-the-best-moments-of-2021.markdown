As the start of a new year approaches, this time offers a unique opportunity to look back on what the soon-to-be old year brought for DC SCORES. 

While we all continue to navigate the ongoing challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, we can also recognize the successes and uplifting moments that 2021 brought as well. One thing that’s been constant is DC SCORES’ mission of creating neighborhood teams that give kids the confidence and skills to succeed on the playing field, in the classroom, and in life.





Our biggest success this year is without a doubt returning to in-person programming for the over 3,000 kids that we serve in D.C. annually. Distance-learning provided unique opportunities that we didn’t consider previously, but having kids reunited with their teammates and coaches is without a doubt what brings the most joy for our poet-athletes. 

We aren’t sure what 2022 will bring, but we’re optimistic about the future and DC SCORES will continue working hard for kids in the District.

We hope you enjoy taking a look back at our 10 favorite moments of 2021 (in no particular order)!

## 10. Fall Frenzy 

One of the most missed parts of our program for poet-athletes and their families was our annual events. Not only do our events offer a fun opportunity for teams to bond in a festive atmosphere, they also showcase how every poet-athlete is part of a bigger community that expands across nearly every ward in DC.

[The Fields at RFK Campus](https://rfkfields.com/) hosted an array of events this season for our poet-athletes and supporters. October was a jam-packed soccer extravaganza with [Junior Frenzy](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dcscorespictures/albums/72157720066464355) on October 13th for over 250 1st and 2nd graders, and [Fall Frenzy](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dcscorespictures/albums/72157720067097403) on October 23rd for more than 500 3rd-5th graders from over 30 schools. Both soccer tournaments and community festivals hosted all of our elementary school teams and their families for fun-filled days that everyone could enjoy.

For Fall Frenzy, in particular, it’s impossible to talk about the success of the event without recognizing our extraordinary volunteers and supporters that showed up to make sure every field had a referee, every activity booth was enthusiastically managed, and every attendee received a meal throughout the day. Special shoutout to [EagleBank](https://www.eaglebankcorp.com/) (event sponsor), [Bethesda Soccer Club](https://www.bethesdasoccer.org/), [Penya Barcelonista Washington DC](https://fcbarcelonadc.com/), [D.C. United](https://www.dcunited.com/), [Washington Spirit](https://washingtonspirit.com/), and every single volunteer that made Fall Frenzy a memorable experience for our poet-athletes and families.
