The end of another year is a natural time for reflection. For many of us, this time is an opportunity to ruminate about all the standout moments that make the ending year one to not forget.

No matter what, 2020 will always be remembered as a very difficult time for everyone. A year where everyone had to adapt to the arduous circumstances that affected us all and kept us physically apart when all we really needed was to be together.

Despite all the hardships felt this year, DC SCORES has never stopped serving kids in DC. With that mission in mind, this year gave us the opportunity to be creative and work with our partners and supporters like never before to keep kids feeling safe, supported, connected, and hopeful.

As we anticipate the arrival of a new year that we all hope brings us a step closer to being physically together, we want to highlight some of our favorite moments of this year that brought brightness when we needed it most.

We hope you enjoy taking a look back at our top 10 favorite moments (in no particular order)!

### 6. Summer SCORES

Since in-person camps were not permitted under DC’s reopening guidelines this year, summer SCORES went virtual!

SCORES at Home Summer Camps served more than 550 kids and ran from June 22nd to July 24th. This special edition of camp was open to all kids in rising grades 1-9 and included a combination of guided activities and live sessions, and like always, was completely FREE. The summer camps were created with SCORES participants in-mind (emphasizing our values of teamwork, leadership, and commitment), but were appropriate for, and open to, all kids, even those outside of DC. 

The summer also hosted an additional camp tailored for our participants that wanted to hone their poetry skills. The first-ever Our Words Our City camp included daily sessions catered to improving the campers writing and performance abilities. Campers also had the incredible opportunity to participate in workshops led by amazing spoken word artists like World Poetry Slam Champion, [Porsha O](http://www.porshaolayiwola.com/bio) and award-winning poet and actor, [Carvens Lissaint](https://www.carvenslissaint.com/about), who starred as George Washington in the Tony Award-winning musical HAMILTON. Additionally, every writing camp participant was supplied with an iPad thanks to a generous DC SCORES supporter!

### 5. Poet-Athlete Kits

![50093851378_937b86b4d8_o.jpg](/uploads/50093851378_937b86b4d8_o.jpg)

One of our goals when planning the virtual season was to eliminate as many participation barriers as possible. Some of those barriers simply come down to not having the equipment and supplies necessary to participate.

In preparation for our summer camp and fall season, DC SCORES staff and volunteers **packed up and mailed over 2,000 [poet-athlete kits](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dcscorespictures/albums/72157715830188717)**. Each kit had everything participants would need to fully participate in programming: DC SCORES t-shirt and mask, soccer ball, disc cones, hand pump, water bottle, pencils, journal and more!

Packing all those kits in the middle of the summer at Audi Field wouldn’t have been possible without the help of incredible volunteers that showed up to do their part in bringing DC SCORES to the homes of our poet-athletes. All of our volunteers contributed in such a meaningful way and two volunteers in particular, **Laurie Gonzalez** and **Kemba Ford** – both Advisory Council members – really shined for their commitment and coming out in full force.


Gonzalez, who works with one of our longtime partners – Deloitte, and is a member of the D.C. United supporters group – Screaming Eagles, stopped by our packing assembly line on multiple occasions to help in any way she could to get the kits out to kids ASAP. Ford made a huge difference by cutting down our packing and shipping time tremendously by bringing some of her sorority sisters from Delta Sigma Theta – Federal City Alumnae Chapter. 

Throughout the summer and fall, the DC SCORES team worked with coaches to plan numerous equipment kit drop-offs at schools so even if kits got lost in the mail, poet-athletes could still get everything necessary to participate.

Along with mailing kits, the DC SCORES staff also mailed out [SCORES Rewards](https://rewards.dcscores.org/home) – a collection of rewards kids can collect by accomplishing certain tasks during the season like perfect attendance, 200 touches on a ball, and so on. Kids not only got the opportunity to receive fresh DC SCORES gear mailed to their house, but they also contributed to team goals for special prizes like celebrity special guests drop-ins during their practice!

### 4. Washington Spirit

![50324423896_da611fa52c_k.jpg](/uploads/50324423896_da611fa52c_k.jpg)

We finally made it official with the Washington Spirit! In the spring, National Women’s Soccer League club the Washington Spirit, and DC SCORES, [announced a multi-year deal](https://www.dcscores.org/blog/2020/04/washington-spirit-and-dc-scores-announce-long-term-community-partnership) making us an official community partner of the team.

This special partnership is modeled after our [affiliation with D.C. United](https://www.dcscores.org/about-us/dc-united/), with the goals of growing the number of girls in the region who play soccer, giving female DC SCORES soccer players more opportunities to see and work with professional female role models, and providing Spirit players more opportunities for local, team-related community service, and increase awareness and visibility of the Spirit and its impact in the DC community.

The Spirit have really shown up for our poet-athletes in a variety of ways this year. From volunteering to pack hundreds of equipment kits in the summer at Audi Field to popping in as special guests during virtual programming.

There were also so many unique opportunities the Spirit found to support us financially this year. During their participation in the NWSL Fall Series tournament, they picked DC SCORES as their beneficiary for their [Verizon Community Shield](https://www.nwslsoccer.com/news/article/national-womens-soccer-league-announces-winner-of-verizon-community-shield) success. They also teamed up with Events DC and DC SCORES to host a special drive-in Spirit game watch party, with ticket sales benefitting our program.

Everyone part of the Washington Spirit organization have been great advocates for DC SCORES, but this year we have to give a special shout out to players **Paige Nielsen** and **Ashley Hatch**, who constantly look for ways to be involved with our poet-athletes and have hosted cleat donations and even [donated goal bonuses](https://www.deseret.com/sports/2020/6/27/21304846/former-byu-star-ashley-hatch-pledges-donations-from-nwsl-earnings-to-support-black-communities) to our mission.

### 3. Our Words Our City

February 2020 seems so long ago but we all remember it fondly because of [*Our Words Our City*](https://www.dcscores.org/blog/2020/02/magic-on-the-stage-during-our-words-our-city). Studio Theatre once again opened its doors for the sixth edition of this black box theater poetry showcase and it had a special aura to it as we continued celebrating our 25th anniversary.

This year’s *Our Words Our City* celebrated the past, present, and future of DC SCORES with 16 poet-athletes and alumni taking the stage, alongside professional spoken word artists, including featured poet of the event and longtime supporter, [Clint Smith](http://www.clintsmithiii.com/).

Later in April, which is National Poetry Month, we hosted our first-ever live virtual event called *Our Words Our City LIVE*, which celebrated the [Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Our-Words-City/dp/B07XM99Q64/ref=sr_1_1?crid=16IEWTCR8DSBI&dchild=1&keywords=our+words+our+city&qid=1608663647&sprefix=our+words+our%2Caps%2C139&sr=8-1) debut of the showcase. In addition to the recorded showcase, the event featured live commentary from teaching artists that performed in the event, including Marjan Naderi and Jacob Mayberry, and special poetry performances from **Washington Spirit** and **D.C. United players**. 

Both the live and virtual *Our Words Our City* events are best described by host committee member Hiram Larew, “A memory-making evening. Thanks to all the magicians who made it shine.”

Even with all the difficulties that a virtual world presents, there are still pockets of unique opportunities that DC SCORES has been able to tap into to make programming special for our poet-athletes. A brand new series we piloted in the summer and continued in the fall was our [Celebrity Guest Speaker Series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaMKH-_ipEg9TTSpyqpCED7HcKrDxk-dy).

We’ve had amazing celebrity guests spend their afternoons virtually with our poet-athletes discussing their personal experiences and offering invaluable advice to everyone watching. Our participants also had the unique opportunity to ask them questions and even perform some of their original poetry they’ve been working on during the summer and fall.

This year’s celebrity guest speakers included:
* **Charlie Davies** – Former U.S. Men’s National Team player
* **Mwende “FreeQuency” Katwiwa** – 2018 Women of the World Poetry Slam Champion
* **Staci Wilson** – Former U.S. Women’s National Team player and Olympic Gold Winner
* **Mohamed “KingCJ0” Alioune Diop** – D.C. United professional eSports athlete

* **Kevin Paredes** – D.C. United Homegrown player
* **Griffin Yow** – D.C. United Homegrown player
* **Herculez Gomez** – ESPN commentator and former U.S. Men’s National Team player
* **Sebastian Salazar** – ESPN Host-Anchor-Reporter and DC SCORES coach
* **Crystal Dunn** – U.S. Women's National Team and Portland Thorns FC player
* **Jason Reynolds** – Best-selling author and National Ambassador for Young People's Literature

Additionally,  this fall [DC SCORES hosted a special panel](https://youtu.be/9OdOEyn5zs8) with three D.C. Youth Poet Laureates, Marjan Naderi, MalPractice (Malachi Byrd) and Kenneth Carroll, to discuss what it is like being a young professional poet.

### 1. SCORES at Home

![SCORES at home TW.png](/uploads/SCORES%20at%20home%20TW.png)

In early March when we all went remote and the spring season needed to go virtual, the program team at DC SCORES created [SCORES at Home](https://families.dcscores.org/at-home-activities), a series of at-home soccer and writing activities for kids.

The SCORES at-home activities were created with SCORES participants in-mind but are appropriate for all students in grades 3-8, with separate Junior SCORES activities for grades K-2.

All of the activities include a [video](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaMKH-_ipEg_O1hjiG5MjmtukQwqN0tVn) that walks participants through soccer drills or writing prompts, as well as an accompanying worksheet (available in English and in [Spanish](https://familias.dcscores.org/actividades-desde-casa)) that kids can download and fill out on their own.

SCORES at Home is really the foundation of our virtual programming. The main programmatic North Star throughout the pandemic has been to keep kids connected and hopeful no matter where they are. We know we can’t make our virtual program look like usual, but there’s a lot we can do to make it feel like DC SCORES for our poet-athletes.
