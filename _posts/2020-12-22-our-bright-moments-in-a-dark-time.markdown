The end of another year is a natural time for reflection. For many of us, this time is an opportunity to ruminate about all the standout moments that make the ending year one to not forget.

No matter what, 2020 will always be remembered as a very difficult time for everyone. A year where everyone had to adapt to the arduous circumstances that affected us all and kept us physically apart when all we really needed was to be together.

Despite all the hardships felt this year, DC SCORES has never stopped serving kids in DC. With that mission in mind, this year gave us the opportunity to be creative and work with our partners and supporters like never before to keep kids feeling safe, supported, connected, and hopeful.

As we anticipate the arrival of a new year that we all hope brings us a step closer to being physically together, we want to highlight some of our favorite moments of this year that brought brightness when we needed it most.

We hope you enjoy taking a look back at our top 10 favorite moments (in no particular order)!

Even with all the difficulties that a virtual world presents, there are still pockets of unique opportunities that DC SCORES has been able to tap into to make programming special for our poet-athletes. A brand new series we piloted in the summer and continued in the fall was our [Celebrity Guest Speaker Series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaMKH-_ipEg9TTSpyqpCED7HcKrDxk-dy).

We’ve had amazing celebrity guests spend their afternoons virtually with our poet-athletes discussing their personal experiences and offering invaluable advice to everyone watching. Our participants also had the unique opportunity to ask them questions and even perform some of their original poetry they’ve been working on during the summer and fall.

This year’s celebrity guest speakers included:
* **Charlie Davies** – Former U.S. Men’s National Team player
* **Mwende “FreeQuency” Katwiwa** – 2018 Women of the World Poetry Slam Champion
* **Staci Wilson** – Former U.S. Women’s National Team player and Olympic Gold Winner
* **Mohamed “KingCJ0” Alioune Diop** – D.C. United professional eSports athlete
* **Ben Olsen** – Former D.C. United Head Coach
* **Moses Nyeman** – D.C. United Homegrown player
* **Kevin Paredes** – D.C. United Homegrown player
* **Griffin Yow** – D.C. United Homegrown player
* **Herculez Gomez ** – ESPN commentator and former U.S. Men’s National Team player
* **Sebastian Salazar** – ESPN Host-Anchor-Reporter and DC SCORES coach
* **Crystal Dunn** – U.S. Women's National Team and Portland Thorns FC player
* **Jason Reynolds** – Best-selling author and National Ambassador for Young People's Literature

Additionally,  this fall [DC SCORES hosted a special panel](https://youtu.be/9OdOEyn5zs8) with three D.C. Youth Poet Laureates, Marjan Naderi, MalPractice (Malachi Byrd) and Kenneth Carroll, to discuss what it is like being a young professional poet.

### 1. SCORES at Home

In early March when we all went remote and the spring season needed to go virtual, the program team at DC SCORES created [SCORES at Home](https://families.dcscores.org/at-home-activities), a series of at-home soccer and writing activities for kids.

The SCORES at-home activities were created with SCORES participants in-mind but are appropriate for all students in grades 3-8, with separate Junior SCORES activities for grades K-2.

All of the activities include a [video](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaMKH-_ipEg_O1hjiG5MjmtukQwqN0tVn) that walks participants through soccer drills or writing prompts, as well as an accompanying worksheet (available in English and in [Spanish](https://familias.dcscores.org/actividades-desde-casa)) that kids can download and fill out on their own.

SCORES at Home is really the foundation of our virtual programming. The main programmatic North Star throughout the pandemic has been to keep kids connected and hopeful no matter where they are. We know we can’t make our virtual program look like usual, but there’s a lot we can do to make it feel like DC SCORES for our poet-athletes.
