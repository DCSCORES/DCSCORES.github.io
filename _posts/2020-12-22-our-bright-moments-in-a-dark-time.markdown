The end of another year is a natural time for reflection. For many of us, this time is an opportunity to ruminate about all the standout moments that make the ending year one to not forget.





No matter what, 2020 will always be remembered as a very difficult time for everyone. A year where everyone had to adapt to the arduous circumstances that affected us all and kept us physically apart when all we really needed was to be together.

Despite all the hardships felt this year, DC SCORES has never stopped serving kids in DC. With that mission in mind, this year gave us the opportunity to be creative and work with our partners and supporters like never before to keep kids feeling safe, supported, connected, and hopeful.

As we anticipate the arrival of a new year that we all hope brings us a step closer to being physically together, we want to highlight some of our favorite moments of this year that brought brightness when we needed it most.

We hope you enjoy taking a look back at our top 10 favorite moments (in no particular order)!

### 1. SCORES at Home

In early March when we all went remote and the spring season needed to go virtual, the program team at DC SCORES created [SCORES at Home](https://families.dcscores.org/at-home-activities), a series of at-home soccer and writing activities for kids.

The SCORES at-home activities were created with SCORES participants in-mind but are appropriate for all students in grades 3-8, with separate Junior SCORES activities for grades K-2. 

All of the activities include a [video](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaMKH-_ipEg_O1hjiG5MjmtukQwqN0tVn) that walks participants through soccer drills or writing prompts, as well as an accompanying worksheet (available in English and in [Spanish](https://familias.dcscores.org/actividades-desde-casa)) that kids can download and fill out on their own.

SCORES at Home is really the foundation of our virtual programming. The main programmatic North Star throughout the pandemic has been to keep kids connected and hopeful no matter where they are. We know we can’t make our virtual program look like usual, but there’s a lot we can do to make it feel like DC SCORES for our poet-athletes.
