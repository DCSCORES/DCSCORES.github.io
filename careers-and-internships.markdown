## Job Openings

**Events Manager** <br>

DC SCORES is looking for someone with the attention to detail, creativity, and can-do attitude necessary to plan, manage and execute a wide range of events for a wide range of audiences. The Events Manager will be the “project manager in chief” both for a) major program events—outdoor soccer tournaments and community festivals for 1,000+ kids and their families, trainings for hundreds of coaches, and poetry slams in front of hundreds in high school gymnasiums—and b) fundraising events—including a gala at D.C. United’s Audi Field for 500+ VIPs, a corporate charity soccer tournament, and poetry showcases at some of the most prestigious theater venues in the city. The Events Manager is the event guru of the entire staff, and will need to work closely with both the program team and development team to understand the vision, goals, and key stakeholders of each event, and then project manage colleagues, sponsors, vendors, and volunteers to execute impactful events.
