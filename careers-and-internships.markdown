([learn more](https://dcscores.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0mn9h/))

##### [Community Engagement Coordinator](https://dcscores.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0mn8m/)

This position is perfect for a recent college graduate eager to get an inside look at and hands-on experience in how to run a high-performing nonprofit. The role is part customer service, part project management, part development operations, part volunteer coordination, and part communications. This is neither a typical desk job nor a typical field job. On any given day, the Coordinator could be facilitating a corporate volunteer group prepping equipment for kids in our program; writing an award application to honor the contributions of an individual volunteer; staffing a table at a government agency volunteer fair; entering/updating data in Salesforce; sending donor thank you notes; emailing with people interested in learning more about DC SCORES or volunteering; and planning the volunteers’ schedule for our annual soccer tournament. ([learn more](https://dcscores.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0mn8m/))

##### [Director of Programs](https://dcscores.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0mnty/)

This position is perfect for an individual with classroom experience who is passionate about youth development and supporting youth during out-of-school time hours, and who both excels at and enjoys building and maintaining supportive, productive relationships with colleagues and school partners. There is significant opportunity for growth in this role over the next 2-4 years, including developing general nonprofit management and leadership skills, and leading projects that affect >10,000 America SCORES participants around the country. This is not a typical desk job nor a typical field job. ([learn more](https://dcscores.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0mnty/))

##### [Program Data Coordinator](https://dcscores.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0mntb/)

This position is perfect for a highly detail-oriented, numbers-loving recent college graduate eager to get an inside look at — and hands-on experience in using data to manage — high-performing nonprofit programs. The role is part program evaluator, part database manager, part compliance officer, part grant reporter, part tech support, and part executive assistant. This role is far from a typical desk job. On any given day, the Coordinator could be contacting coaches to update their personnel files, crunching survey results from hundreds of our participants, running a physical fitness evaluation blitz at one of our sites, running coach payroll, or creating presentations of data subsets for grant reports. ([learn more](https://dcscores.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0mntb/))

##### [Communications Fellow](https://dcscores.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0mnk3/) (part-time)
