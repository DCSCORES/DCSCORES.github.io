## Game Day Referee

![Referee](/uploads/volunteer-referee-float-left.jpg)

**Description:**
DC SCORES’ soccer leagues focus on our three values: teamwork, leadership, and commitment. Basic soccer knowledge is required and volunteers are asked to complete a brief, one-time mandatory training on DC SCORES league rules.

**Requirements:**
For elementary school games: volunteers will be asked to make basic calls, such as throw-ins, corner kicks, and goal kicks. For Junior SCORES, no specific referee knowledge is required. Volunteers must be at least 15 years of age, have a negative TB test from the last two years, and pass a background check.

**When?**
Thursdays (Elementary) from 3:45pm to 6pm. <br>

**Where?**
At <a href="/our-program/program-sites/" target="_blank">sites</a> throughout DC. We will do our best to place you based on your location and mode of transportation.

**Schedule**
DC SCORES games are expected to resume in March 2022.
