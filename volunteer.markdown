# Volunteer with DC SCORES!

Thank you so much for your interest in volunteering with DC SCORES. Volunteers are at the core of our organization, enabling us to serve more than 3,000 young people at over 60 schools across Washington D.C.

Volunteers are integral to empowering DC SCORES to provide high-quality programming to poet-athletes all over our city. Volunteers serve in a variety of capacities, from refereeing kids’ gamedays to providing pro-bono photoshoots of our work.

We welcome volunteers of all backgrounds at DC SCORES. If you are interested in supporting young people in the District and have questions about our work, please contact Margot Locker (mlocker@dcscores.org) for more information.

**Description:**
During the spring season (March to May) we have weekly game days on Thursdays (4-6pm) for our elementary school program. The smooth operation of these game days relies on our volunteer referees and, with 20\+ weekly games all over the city, we’re always looking for more volunteers!


Contact Margot Locker, Community Engagement Manager, at mlocker@dcscores for more information.
