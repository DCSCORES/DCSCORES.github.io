For elementary school games: volunteers will be asked to make basic calls, such as throw-ins, corner kicks, and goal kicks. For middle school games: volunteers will be expected to call additional fouls, indirect/direct kicks, and offside. Volunteers must be at least 15 years of age.

**When?**
Thursdays (Elementary) from 3:45pm to 6pm.
